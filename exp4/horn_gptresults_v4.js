Therefore, `p4` is false.  **Newly derived variable:** `not(p4)` (i.e., `p4` is false) from `(not(p4) or p2)` and `not(p2)`.  #### Statement 5: `not(p2) or p4` `not(p2)` is true because `p2` is false. This simplifies to `true or p4`, which is always true. No new information is derived.  #### Statement 6: `not(p6) or not(p1) or p4` `not(p6)` is unknown. `not(p1)` is false because `p1` is true. `p4` is false (`not(p4)` is true). This simplifies to `not(p6)`. Therefore, `p6` is false.  **Newly derived variable:** `not(p6)` (i.e., `p6` is false) from `(not(p6) or not(p1) or p4)` and `p1` and `not(p4)`.  #### Statement 7: `not(p6) or not(p1) or p5` `not(p6)` is true because `p6` is false. This simplifies to `true or not(p1) or p5`, which is always true. No new information is derived.  #### Statement 9: `not(p4) or not(p3) or p6` `not(p4)` is true because `p4` is false. This simplifies to `true or not(p3) or p6`, which is always true. No new information is derived.  ### Step 4: Check for contradictions We now check if any fully negative statement contradicts the derived variables.  `not(p3)` is true, and `p3` is false. No contradiction. `not(p5)` is true, and `p5` is false. No contradiction. `not(p2)` is true, and `p2` is false. No contradiction. `not(p4)` is true, and `p4` is false. No contradiction. `not(p6)` is true, and `p6` is false. No contradiction.  ### Final Answer: All statements are consistent.   **Answer: satisfiable.** "]

This reduces the statement to `not(p6) or not(p4) or not(p2)`.

Since `p5` is already true, no new information is derived.  11. **Statement: `not(p3) or not(p1) or p2`**     - `p3` is true and `p1` is false, so this simplifies to `p2`. Since `p2` is already true, no new information is derived.  ### Step 2: Check for contradictions We now check if any fully negative statement contradicts the derived and given true variables:   - `not(p7)` is consistent with `p7` being false.   - `not(p1)` is consistent with `p1` being false.   - `not(p6)` is consistent with `p6` being false.  ### Final Answer: No contradictions were found.

Now, the known true variables are `p1`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`, `p6`, `p7`, and `not(p2)`.  There are no fully negative statements that contradict the known true variables. - "]

Explanation: `p1` is directly derivable because `p7` is true, and the clause `not(p7) or p1` requires `p1` to be true.  Output: ``` p1 from (not(p7) or p1) and p7 ```  ---  #### Derivation 2: From `not(p1) or p3` and `p1`, we can derive: `p3` is true. Explanation: `p3` is directly derivable because `p1` is true, and the clause `not(p1) or p3` requires `p3` to be true.

Explanation: `p6` is directly derivable because `p3` is true, and the clause `not(p6) or p3` requires `p6` to be true.  Output: ``` p6 from (not(p6) or p3) and p3 ```  ---  #### Derivation 5: From `not(p5) or p6` and `p6`, we can derive: `p5` is true. Explanation: `p5` is directly derivable because `p6` is true, and the clause `not(p5) or p6` requires `p5` to be true.

Since p7 is true, `not(p7)` is false. Therefore, p3 must be true. **p3 from (not(p7) or p3) and p7.**  #### Derivation 2: From statement 5: `not(p7) or p6`. Since p7 is true, `not(p7)` is false. Therefore, p6 must be true. However, p6 is already known to be true, so no new information is derived here.  #### Derivation 3: From statement 7: `not(p5) or p3`. Since p3 is true, `not(p5)` must be false. Therefore, p5 must be true. **p5 from (not(p5) or p3) and p3.**  #### Derivation 4: From statement 6: `not(p5) or p1`. Since p5 is true, `not(p5)` is false. Therefore, p1 must be true. **p1 from (not(p5) or p1) and p5.**  #### Derivation 5: From statement 14: `not(p5) or not(p1) or p4`. Since p5 is true and p1 is true, both `not(p5)` and `not(p1)` are false. Therefore, p4 must be true. **p4 from (not(p5) or not(p1) or p4) and p5 and p1.**  ### Step 3: Check for contradictions #### Contradiction Check 1: From statement 1: `not(p2)`. This means p2 is false.  #### Contradiction Check 2: From statement 8: `not(p4) or not(p2)`. Since p4 is true, `not(p4)` is false. Therefore, `not(p2)` must be true, which is consistent with p2 being false. No contradiction here.  #### Contradiction Check 3: From statement 9: `not(p7) or not(p6) or not(p4)`. Since p7, p6, and p4 are all true, `not(p7)`, `not(p6)`, and `not(p4)` are all false.

No new variable is derived.   **Statement 6: `not(p4) or p5.`**    - Since `p4` is false, `not(p4)` is true. This statement is satisfied. No new variable is derived.   **Statement 7: `not(p4) or p6.`**    - Since `p4` is false, `not(p4)` is true. This statement is satisfied. No new variable is derived.   **Statement 8: `not(p2) or p6.`**    - No information about `p2` or `p6` yet. No new variable is derived.   **Statement 9: `not(p1) or p4.`**    - Since `p4` is false, this means `not(p1)` must be true. Therefore, `p1` is false.     **Derived: `not(p1)` (i.e., `p1` is false) from (not(p1) or p4) and not(p4).**   **Statement 10: `not(p7) or not(p4) or not(p3).`**    - Since `p7` is true, `not(p7)` is false.    - Since `p4` is false, `not(p4)` is true. This statement is satisfied. No new variable is derived.  10. **Statement 11: `not(p5) or not(p3) or p6.`**     - Since `p5` is true, `not(p5)` is false. No information about `p3` or `p6` yet.

No new variable is derived.  12. **Statement 13: `not(p4) or not(p2) or p6.`**     - Since `p4` is false, `not(p4)` is true. This statement is satisfied. No new variable is derived.  13. **Statement 14: `not(p3) or not(p1) or p7.`**     - Since `p1` is false, `not(p1)` is true. This statement is satisfied.

We now have the following true variables:   - `p5` (given).   - `not(p4)` (derived from Statement 3).   - `p7` (derived from Statement 4).   - `not(p1)` (derived from Statement 9).  Check all statements for contradictions:   - No fully negative statement (e.g., `not(pX)`) contradicts the known true variables.   - No derived variable contradicts another derived variable.  ---  ### Final Answer: **satisfiable** "]

This implies `p3` must be false.       **Derivation**: `not(p3) from (not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3)) and p5 and p4`.  15. **`not(p4) or not(p3) or p1`**:       `p4` is true, and `p3` is false, so this simplifies to `p1`.       **Derivation**: `p1 from (not(p4) or not(p3) or p1) and p4 and not(p3)`.  16. **`not(p3) or not(p2) or p4`**:       `p2` is true, and `p3` is false, so this simplifies to `p4`.       `p4` is already true, so this statement is satisfied but does not derive anything new.  17. **`not(p3) or not(p2) or p5`**:       `p2` is true, and `p3` is false, so this simplifies to `p5`.       `p5` is already true, so this statement is satisfied but does not derive anything new.  18. **`not(p7) or not(p4) or not(p1) or p6`**:       `p4` and `p1` are true, so this simplifies to `not(p7) or p6`.       Since neither `p7` nor `p6` is known to be true, we cannot derive anything yet.  19. **`not(p7) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p6`**:       `p2` is true, and `p3` is false, so this simplifies to `not(p7) or p6`.       Since neither `p7` nor `p6` is known to be true, we cannot derive anything yet.  ---  ### Step 2: Check for contradictions We now check if any fully negative statement contradicts the known true variables.   **`not(p3)`**:      `p3` is false, so this is consistent.   **`not(p5)`**:      `p5` is true, so this is consistent.   **`not(p4)`**:      `p4` is true, so this is consistent.   **`not(p1)`**:      `p1` is true, so this is consistent.   **`not(p7)`**:      `p7` is not known to be true, so this is consistent.   **`not(p6)`**:      `p6` is not known to be true, so this is consistent.  ---  ### Final Answer: No contradictions were found, and all statements are satisfied.   **Answer**: satisfiable.

This means `p7` must be false.   **Statement: `not(p7) or not(p5) or p4`**      Since `p5` is true and `p4` is true, this is satisfied regardless of `p7`.
