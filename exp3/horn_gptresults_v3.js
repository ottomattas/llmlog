From `not(p2) or p3`, since `p2` is true, we can conclude that `p3` is true.  From `not(p3) or p1`, since `p3` is true, we can conclude that `p1` is true.

Thus, `p4` must be false.  ### Step 4: Derive further variables From the derived information, we now know that `p4` is false. Let's check if this leads to any new derivations:   From `not(p4) or not(p2)`, since `p4` is false, this statement is satisfied regardless of `p2`.  From `not(p4) or p2`, since `p4` is false, this statement is satisfied regardless of `p2`.

From `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3) or p1`, since `p5` is true, `p4` is false, and `p3` is true, this statement is satisfied regardless of `p1`.

From `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p2)`, since `p2` and `p3` are true, `not(p4)` must be true. Therefore, `p4` must be false.  Now we know that `p2`, `p3` are true, and `p4` is false.  ### Step 4: Derive more true variables Using the fact that `p2` and `p3` are true, and `p4` is false: From `not(p4) or p1`, since `p4` is false, `p1` must be true. From `not(p4) or not(p2) or p5`, since `p4` is false and `p2` is true, `p5` must be true.  Now we know that `p2`, `p3`, `p1`, and `p5` are true, and `p4` is false.  ### Step 5: Check for contradictions From `not(p3) or not(p2) or not(p1) or p4`, since `p3`, `p2`, and `p1` are true, `p4` must be true. However, we already know that `p4` is false. This is a **contradiction**.  ### Final Answer: `p3 p1 p5 contradiction` "]

Therefore, `p4` is false.   From `not(p5) or not(p4) or p1`:      Since `p5` is true, this statement is satisfied, but we cannot conclude anything new.  10. From `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p2)`:       Since `p5` is true, this statement is satisfied, but we cannot conclude anything new.  11.

From `not(p4) or not(p1) or p2`:       Since `p4` is false and `p1` is true, this statement is satisfied, but we cannot conclude anything new.  ### Step 2: Check for contradictions.  Now we have the following true variables: `p1`, `p3`, `p2`, `p5`. `p4` is false (`not(p4)` is true).  Let\u2019s check if any statement leads to a contradiction:   From `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3)`:      Since `p5` is true, `p4` is false, and `p3` is true, this statement is satisfied, so no contradiction here.   All other statements are satisfied with the derived true variables and `not(p4)`.  ### Final Answer: No direct contradiction is found, and no new variables can be derived.

No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5`.  `not(p4) or p5`: This means if `p4` is false, then `p5` must be true. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4`.  `not(p3) or p2`: Since `p2` is true, this implies `p3` must also be true.  `not(p5) or not(p4) or p3`: Since `p3` is true, this clause is satisfied regardless of `p5` or `p4`.  `not(p5) or not(p3) or p2`: Since `p3` and `p2` are true, this clause is satisfied regardless of `p5`.  `not(p5) or not(p3) or p4`: Since `p3` is true, this simplifies to `not(p5) or p4`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5` or `p4`.  `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p1)`: Since `p3` is true, this simplifies to `not(p4) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4` or `p1`.  `not(p4) or not(p1) or p2`: Since `p2` is true, this clause is satisfied regardless of `p4` or `p1`.  `not(p4) or not(p1) or p3`: Since `p3` is true, this clause is satisfied regardless of `p4` or `p1`. 10. `not(p3) or not(p1) or p4`: Since `p3` is true, this simplifies to `not(p1) or p4`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p1` or `p4`. 11. `not(p3) or not(p1) or p5`: Since `p3` is true, this simplifies to `not(p1) or p5`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p1` or `p5`. 12. `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p2) or not(p1)`: Since `p2` is true, this simplifies to `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5`, `p4`, or `p1`. 13. `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p2) or not(p1)`: Since `p3` and `p2` are true, this simplifies to `not(p5) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5` or `p1`. 14. `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p1`: Since `p3` and `p2` are true, this simplifies to `not(p4) or p1`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4` or `p1`.  From the above, we can derive that `p3` is true. So far, we have `p2` and `p3` as true variables.  ### Step 3: Derive new true variables again Using the updated set of true variables (`p2` and `p3`), we repeat the process:   `not(p5) or p4`: No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5`.  `not(p4) or p5`: No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4`.  `not(p5) or not(p4) or p3`: This clause is satisfied since `p3` is true.  `not(p5) or not(p3) or p2`: This clause is satisfied since `p3` and `p2` are true.  `not(p5) or not(p3) or p4`: This simplifies to `not(p5) or p4`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5` or `p4`.  `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p1)`: This simplifies to `not(p4) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4` or `p1`.  `not(p4) or not(p1) or p2`: This clause is satisfied since `p2` is true.  `not(p4) or not(p1) or p3`: This clause is satisfied since `p3` is true.  `not(p3) or not(p1) or p4`: This simplifies to `not(p1) or p4`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p1` or `p4`. 10. `not(p3) or not(p1) or p5`: This simplifies to `not(p1) or p5`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p1` or `p5`. 11. `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p2) or not(p1)`: This simplifies to `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5`, `p4`, or `p1`. 12. `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p2) or not(p1)`: This simplifies to `not(p5) or not(p1)`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p5` or `p1`. 13. `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p1`: This simplifies to `not(p4) or p1`. No conclusion yet since we don't know about `p4` or `p1`.  No new variables can be derived in this step.  ### Step 4: Check for contradictions We now check if any fully negative clause contradicts the current set of true variables (`p2` and `p3`):  None of the fully negative clauses (`not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p2) or not(p1)` and `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p2) or not(p1)`) are contradicted because they involve variables (`p5`, `p4`, `p1`) whose truth values are not yet determined.  ### Step 5: Conclusion Since no new variables can be derived and no contradictions are found, the statements are **satisfiable**.  ### Final Answer: ``` p3 satisfiable ``` "]

Therefore, `not(p3)` must be true, which means `p3` is false.   **Statement**: `not(p6) or not(p2) or p1`      Since `p1` is true, this statement is satisfied regardless of the truth values of `p6` and `p2`. No new derivation.   **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p1)`      Since `p1` is true, `not(p1)` is false. This reduces the statement to `not(p5) or not(p4)`. No derivation yet.   **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p3) or p2`      Since `p3` is false, `not(p3)` is true. This makes the statement true regardless of the truth values of `p5` and `p2`. No new derivation.   **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p1) or p2`      Since `p1` is true, `not(p1)` is false. This reduces the statement to `not(p5) or p2`.

No new derivation.  ### Step 3: Check for contradictions At this point, we have derived that `p3` is false. Let's check if this leads to any contradictions:  **Statement**: `not(p3) or not(p1)`     Since `p3` is false, `not(p3)` is true. This statement is satisfied.  **Statement**: `not(p5) or p3`     Since `p3` is false, this reduces to `not(p5)`. This means `p5` is false.  **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p4)`     Since `p5` is false, `not(p5)` is true. This statement is satisfied.  **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p3) or p2`     Since `p5` is false, `not(p5)` is true. This statement is satisfied.  **Statement**: `not(p5) or not(p1) or p2`     Since `p5` is false, `not(p5)` is true. This statement is satisfied.  **Statement**: `not(p4) or not(p1) or p6`     Since `p1` is true, `not(p1)` is false. This reduces to `not(p4) or p6`. No contradiction yet.  **Statement**: `not(p4) or p6`     No derivation yet since neither `p4` nor `p6` is known.  ### Step 4: Derive further From the above, we now know: `p1` is true. `p3` is false. `p5` is false.  Using these, let's recheck the statements:   **Statement**: `not(p6) or p5`      Since `p5` is false, this reduces to `not(p6)`. This means `p6` is false.   **Statement**: `not(p4) or p6`      Since `p6` is false, this reduces to `not(p4)`. This means `p4` is false.  ### Step 5: Check for contradictions again We now know: `p1` is true. `p3` is false. `p5` is false. `p6` is false. `p4` is false.  Let's check all statements for contradictions:  All statements are satisfied with the derived truth values. No contradictions are found.  ### Final Answer: `satisfiable` "]

No new variables are derived.  From `not(p6) or not(p5) or p4`, since `not(p6)` and `not(p5)` are true, this clause is satisfied. No new variables are derived.  No new variables are derived in this step.  ### Step 5: Check for contradictions:  From `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p2)`, since `not(p5)` and `not(p4)` are true, this clause is satisfied. No contradiction.  From `not(p5) or not(p3) or p2`, since `not(p5)` is true, this clause is satisfied. No contradiction.  From `not(p2) or not(p1) or p5`, since `p2` is true, this simplifies to `not(p1) or p5`. Since `p5` is false, this simplifies further to `not(p1)`. Thus, `p1` is false.  Newly derived true variables: `not(p1)`.  ### Step 6: Final check for contradictions:  From `not(p1) or p5`, since `not(p1)` is true, this clause is satisfied. No contradiction.  From `not(p4) or p1`, since `not(p4)` is true, this clause is satisfied. No contradiction.  No further variables can be derived, and no contradictions are found.  ### Final Answer: The statements are **satisfiable**.  Answer: `p3 p5 p4 p6 p1 satisfiable`. "]

No contradictions are found.  ### Final Answer: The statements are **satisfiable**. The derived true variables are `p3 p2 p1 p4 p5`, and the final answer is:  **p3 p2 p1 p4 p5 satisfiable** "]

No new variable can be conclusively derived yet.  From `not(p5) or not(p4) or p2`, since `p5` is true, the clause simplifies to `not(p4) or p2`. This means either `p4` is false or `p2` is true. No new variable can be conclusively derived yet.  From `not(p5) or not(p2) or p6`, since `p5` is true, the clause simplifies to `not(p2) or p6`. This means either `p2` is false or `p6` is true.

No new variable can be conclusively derived yet.  From `not(p3) or not(p1) or p2`, since `p3` is true, the clause simplifies to `not(p1) or p2`. This means either `p1` is false or `p2` is true. No new variable can be conclusively derived yet.  From `not(p3) or not(p1) or p5`, since `p3` is true, the clause simplifies to `not(p1) or p5`. Since `p5` is already true, no new variable can be derived.  From `not(p3) or not(p1) or p6`, since `p3` is true, the clause simplifies to `not(p1) or p6`.

From `not(p5) or p1`, since `p5` is true, `p1` must also be true.  From `not(p6) or p4`, since `p6` is not yet known, we cannot derive anything here.  From `not(p1) or p6`, since `p1` is true, `p6` must also be true.  From `not(p4) or p6`, since `p6` is true, we cannot derive anything about `p4` yet.  From `not(p2) or p3`, since `p2` is not yet known, we cannot derive anything here.  From `not(p2) or p4`, since `p2` is not yet known, we cannot derive anything here.

From `not(p4) or not(p1) or p3`, since both `p4` and `p1` are true, `p3` must also be true.  At this point, we have derived `p4` and `p3`. So far, the true variables are: `p5 p1 p6 p4 p3`.  ### Step 4: Check for contradictions Now that we have derived all possible true variables (`p5 p1 p6 p4 p3`), we will check if any of the given statements lead to a contradiction.   From `not(p6) or not(p5) or not(p4) or p1`, since `p6`, `p5`, and `p4` are all true, this statement is satisfied because `p1` is also true.

From `not(p6) or not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p1)`, since `p6`, `p4`, `p3`, and `p1` are all true, this statement is satisfied because it does not require any new information.  From `not(p6) or not(p4) or not(p1) or p5`, since `p6`, `p4`, and `p1` are all true, this statement is satisfied because `p5` is also true.  From `not(p6) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p1`, since `p6` and `p3` are true, and `p1` is true, this statement implies that `p2` must be false.  From `not(p5) or not(p2) or not(p1) or p6`, since `p5`, `p1`, and `p6` are true, this statement implies that `p2` must be false.  From the above, we have determined that `p2` must be false.

No new variables are derived in this step.  ### Step 3: Derive new true variables using all known true variables (`p3` and `p1`): No further derivations can be made from the remaining statements.  ### Step 4: Check for contradictions:  From `not(p6) or not(p2) or not(p1)`, since `p1` is true, this reduces to `not(p6) or not(p2)`. This means if `p6` is false, then `p2` must be false. No contradiction yet.  From `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3) or p6`, since `p3` is true, this reduces to `not(p5) or not(p4) or p6`. No contradiction yet.  No direct contradictions are found.  ### Final Answer: Since no contradictions are found and no new variables can be derived, the statements are **satisfiable**.  **Answer: satisfiable** "]

From `not(p6) or not(p5) or not(p2)`, since `p6` is true, this simplifies to `not(p5) or not(p2)`.      This means either `p5` is false or `p2` is false.   From `not(p6) or not(p5) or p3`, since `p6` is true, this simplifies to `not(p5) or p3`.      This means either `p5` is false or `p3` is true.

From the first constraint `not(p5) or not(p2)`, we know that either `p5` is false or `p2` is false. From the second constraint `not(p5) or p3`, we know that either `p5` is false or `p3` is true. From the third constraint `not(p2) or not(p1)`, we know that either `p2` is false or `p1` is false.  Let us assume `p5` is true (to avoid contradiction in the second constraint).   If `p5` is true, then from the first constraint, `p2` must be false.   If `p2` is false, then from the third constraint, `p1` must be false.   If `p1` is false, then from the statement `not(p1) or p3`, `p3` must be true.    Now, let us check if this assignment leads to any contradictions: `p6 = true`, `p5 = true`, `p2 = false`, `p1 = false`, `p3 = true`.  Substitute these values into all the statements:  `not(p6) or not(p5) or not(p2)` \u2192 `false or false or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).  `not(p6) or not(p5) or p3` \u2192 `false or false or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).  `not(p2) or not(p1) or p6` \u2192 `true or true or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).  `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3) or p6` \u2192 `false or true or false or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).  `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p2) or p6` \u2192 `false or true or true or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).  `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p6` \u2192 `false or false or true or true` \u2192 true (satisfied).

Now we know: `p3`, `p5`, `p6`, `not(p4)`, `not(p7)`, `p1`.  ### Step 7: Derive more true variables Using the fact that `p1` is true: From `not(p1) or p4`, since `p1` is true, we can derive that `p4` is true.  This is a **contradiction**, because we already know that `p4` is false (`not(p4)` is true).  ### Final Answer: `p5 p6 p1 contradiction` "]

From `not(p7) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p6`: Since `p7`, `p3`, and `p2` are true, this implies `p6` must be false. 10. From `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p1) or p6`: Since `p5`, `p3`, and `p1` are true, this implies `p6` must be false.  No new true variables are derived in this step.  ### Step 3: Check for Contradictions We now check for contradictions using the derived true variables (`p1, p5, p2, p3, p7, p4`) and the derived false variable (`p6`).   From `not(p7) or not(p6) or not(p5)`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  From `not(p7) or not(p5) or p6`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  From `not(p7) or not(p2) or p6`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  From `not(p6) or not(p4) or p3`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  From `not(p6) or not(p3) or p1`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  From `not(p5) or not(p3) or p4`: This statement is satisfied because `p5` and `p3` are true.  From `not(p5) or not(p1) or p4`: This statement is satisfied because `p5` and `p1` are true.  From `not(p3) or not(p2) or p7`: This statement is satisfied because `p3` and `p2` are true.  From `not(p7) or not(p3) or not(p2) or p6`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false. 10. From `not(p5) or not(p3) or not(p1) or p6`: This statement is satisfied because `p6` is false.  No contradictions are found.  ### Final Answer: Since no contradictions are found and no new true variables can be derived, the statements are **satisfiable**.  **Output:** `p2 p3 p7 p4 satisfiable` "]

Thus, the new true variable is: `p4`.  ### Step 6: Final check At this point, all variables have been derived (`p1`, `p2`, `p4`, `p5`, `p6`, `p7` are true, and `p3` is false). No contradictions are found in the given statements.  ### Final Answer: `p1 p2 p5 p6 p4 satisfiable` "]

No new derivation.   `not(p6) or p3`: Since `p6` is not known, this implies `p3` must be true.    - Derive: `p3`.   `not(p5) or p4`: `p5` is true, so this implies `p4` must be true. `p4` is already derived.   `not(p4) or p5`: `p4` is true, so this statement is satisfied. No new derivation.   `not(p3) or p4`: `p3` is true, so this implies `p4` must be true. `p4` is already derived.   `not(p1) or p5`: `p5` is true, so this implies `p1` must be true.    - Derive: `p1`.   `not(p7) or not(p6) or p1`: `p1` is true, so this statement is satisfied.

No new derivation.  11. `not(p6) or not(p5) or not(p1)`: `p5` is true and `p1` is true, so this implies `p6` must be false.    - Derive: `not(p6)`.  12. `not(p6) or not(p3) or p7`: `p6` is false, so this implies `not(p3) or p7`. Since `p3` is true, this implies `p7` must be true.    - Derive: `p7`.  13. `not(p6) or not(p1) or p2`: `p6` is false, so this statement is satisfied. No new derivation.  14. `not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3)`: `p5`, `p4`, and `p3` are all true, so this statement is a **contradiction**.  ### Final Answer: Since a contradiction is found in step 14, the final answer is:  **p4 p3 p1 not(p6) p7 contradiction** "]

From `not(p5) or p3`: Since `p5` is true, `p3` must be true.  From `not(p3) or p1`: Since `p3` is true, `p1` must be true.  From `not(p3) or p4`: Since `p3` is true, `p4` must be true.

From `not(p7) or not(p6) or p2`, since `p6` is true, this simplifies to `not(p7) or p2`. For this to hold, either `p7` is false or `p2` is true. Since we cannot yet conclude anything about `p7`, we derive that `p2` is true.   From `not(p7) or not(p6) or p5`, since `p6` is true, this simplifies to `not(p7) or p5`. For this to hold, either `p7` is false or `p5` is true. Since we cannot yet conclude anything about `p7`, we derive that `p5` is true.   From `not(p2) or p1`, since `p2` is true, this simplifies to `p1`. Thus, `p1` is true.   From `not(p1) or p2`, since `p1` is true, this statement is already satisfied, and no new information is derived.   From `not(p1) or p3`, since `p1` is true, this simplifies to `p3`. Thus, `p3` is true.   From `not(p6) or not(p1) or p3`, since both `p6` and `p1` are true, this simplifies to `p3`. Since `p3` is already true, no new information is derived.   From `not(p5) or not(p4) or p3`, since `p5` and `p3` are true, this simplifies to `not(p4)`. Thus, `p4` is false.  ### Step 3: Check for contradictions Now that we have derived the following: `p6`, `p2`, `p5`, `p1`, and `p3` are true. `p4` is false.  We check the remaining statements for contradictions:   From `not(p7) or not(p4) or not(p1)`, since `p4` is false and `p1` is true, this simplifies to `not(p7)`. Thus, `p7` is false.   From `not(p7) or not(p3) or not(p1)`, since `p7` is false, this statement is satisfied, and no new information is derived.   From `not(p7) or not(p3) or p5`, since `p7` is false, this statement is satisfied, and no new information is derived.   From `not(p4) or not(p2) or p7`, since `p4` is false and `p2` is true, this simplifies to `p7`.

From `not(p4) or p3`, since `p4` is true, `p3` must also be true.  From `not(p4) or p5`, since `p4` is true, `p5` must also be true.  Thus, the new true variables are: `p1 p3 p5`.  ### Step 3: Derive more true variables Using the newly derived true variables (`p1`, `p3`, `p5`) along with `p4`, we can derive the following:  From `not(p3) or p1`, since `p3` is true, this statement is already satisfied, and no new variable is derived.  From `not(p5) or not(p4) or p2`, since `p5` and `p4` are true, `p2` must also be true.  From `not(p5) or not(p1) or p2`, since `p5` and `p1` are true, `p2` must also be true (already derived).  Thus, the new true variable is: `p2`.  ### Step 4: Derive even more true variables Using the newly derived true variable `p2` along with `p1`, `p3`, `p4`, and `p5`, we can derive the following:  From `not(p2) or p7`, since `p2` is true, `p7` must also be true.  From `not(p6) or not(p2) or p7`, since `p2` is true and `p7` is true, this statement is already satisfied, and no new variable is derived.  Thus, the new true variable is: `p7`.  ### Step 5: Derive even more true variables Using the newly derived true variable `p7` along with all previously derived variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`), we can derive the following:  From `not(p7) or p6`, since `p7` is true, `p6` must also be true.  From `not(p7) or not(p5) or p3`, since `p7` and `p5` are true, this statement is already satisfied, and no new variable is derived.  From `not(p7) or not(p4) or p6`, since `p7` and `p4` are true, this statement is already satisfied, and no new variable is derived.  Thus, the new true variable is: `p6`.  ### Step 6: Check for contradictions Now that we have derived all possible true variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`, `p6`, `p7`), we check for contradictions:  From `not(p7) or not(p5) or not(p4) or not(p3)`, since `p7`, `p5`, `p4`, and `p3` are all true, this statement is violated, leading to a **contradiction**.  ### Final Answer: `p1 p3 p5 p2 p7 p6 contradiction` "]
