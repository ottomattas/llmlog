Your task is to solve a problem in propositional logic containing both facts and if-then rules.
You will get a list of facts and if-then rules and have to determine whether a fact p0 can be derived from this list.

Print the derivation as a sequence of facts with parents, one per token, followed by the final 'yes' if p0 is derived or 'no' otherwise.
For example: p2[p1] p4[p2,p3] p0[p4] yes

Statements:
{{ clauses }}

Print only the derivation tokens and the final yes/no.
