Your task is to solve a problem in propositional logic.
You will get a list of statements and have to determine whether the statements form a logical contradiction or not.
If the statements form a contradiction, the last word of your answer should be 'contradiction',
otherwise the last word should be either 'satisfiable' or 'unknown'.

Propositional variables are represent as 'pN' where N is a number. They are either true or false.
'X or Y' means that X is true or Y is true or both X and Y are true.
All the given statements are implicitly connected with 'and': they are all claimed to be true.

Two examples:
Example 1. Statements: p1 is true. p1 is false or p2 is true. p2 is false. Answer: contradiction.
Example 2. Statements: p1 is true. p1 is true or p2 is true. p2 is false. Answer: satisfiable.

Statements:
p1 is true.
p3 is false or p1 is true.
p3 is false or p2 is true.
p2 is false or p1 is false.
p2 is false or p1 is true.
p3 is false or p2 is false or p1 is true.

Please think step by step and answer whether the given statements form a logical contradiction or is satisfiable.
