Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem.

Choose the appropriate interpretation based on how the statements are rendered below.
- If you see facts like "p1." and rules like "if p2 and p3 then p4.", treat them as Horn facts and implications, and determine whether p0 can be derived.
- If you see disjunctions like "p1 is true or p2 is false." or compact forms like "p1 or not(p2).", treat them as CNF clauses, and determine whether the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Conventions
- Propositional variables are written as pN, where N is a number.
- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Answer format
- For Horn tasks (style: horn_if_then): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: "yes" if p0 is derivable from the given facts and rules; otherwise "no". Do not output any other words (do not output "contradiction"/"satisfiable"/"unknown").
- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: "contradiction" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise "satisfiable", or "unknown" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output "yes"/"no").

Examples (Horn, yes/no)
- p1. if p1 then p0. → yes
- p1. if p1 then p9. → no
- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. → yes

Examples (CNF, contradiction)
- p1 is true. not(p1) or p2. p2 is false. → contradiction.
- p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). → contradiction.
- p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). → satisfiable.
