Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem.

Choose the appropriate interpretation based on how the statements are rendered below.
- If you see facts like "p1." and rules like "if p2 and p3 then p4.", treat them as Horn facts and implications, and determine whether p0 can be derived.
- If you see disjunctions like "p1 is true or p2 is false." or compact forms like "p1 or not(p2).", treat them as CNF clauses, and determine whether the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Conventions
- Propositional variables are written as pN, where N is a number.
- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Answer format
- For Horn tasks (style: horn_if_then): Output only a final single word "yes" if p0 is derivable from the given facts and rules, or "no" otherwise.
- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output a final single word as your last token: "contradiction" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable), otherwise "satisfiable" or "unknown".

Examples (Horn, yes/no)
- p1. if p1 then p0. → yes
- p1. if p1 then p9. → no
- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. → yes

Examples (CNF, contradiction)
- p1 is true. not(p1) or p2. p2 is false. → contradiction.
- p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). → contradiction.
- p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). → satisfiable.
