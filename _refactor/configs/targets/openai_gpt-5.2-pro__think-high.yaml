name: openai_gpt-5.2-pro__think-high

# Single-target set for focused prompt/dataset experiments.
#
# Notes:
# - We enable "thinking" and set reasoning effort to high.
# - We still require the model to print a human-readable trace in the completion_text,
#   because provider "reasoning tokens" are usually not returned as full text.
