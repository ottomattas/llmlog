whether the statements form a logical contradiction (unsatisfiable) or not.\n\nSemantics\n- Propositional variables are written as pN where N is a number.\n- Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nHorn restriction (this suite is run on Horn-only inputs)\n- Every clause is a Horn clause: it contains at most one positive literal (\"pX is true\").\n\nAlgorithm (Horn-SAT forward chaining)\n- Let T be the set of variables known to be true, initially containing every variable pK that appears as a positive unit clause \"pK is true.\".\n- Repeat:\n  - For each Horn rule clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... or pX is true.\":\n    - If every antecedent variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then add pX to T (if not already present).\n  - For each fully negative clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... .\":\n    - If every variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then a contradiction is forced.\n- Stop when either:\n  - a contradiction is found, or\n  - no new variables can be added to T.\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.\n- If you print derived variables, prefer printing one derived variable per line (e.g., \"p7\").\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np10 is

whether the statements form a logical contradiction (unsatisfiable) or not.\n\nSemantics\n- Propositional variables are written as pN where N is a number.\n- Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nHorn restriction (this suite is run on Horn-only inputs)\n- Every clause is a Horn clause: it contains at most one positive literal (\"pX is true\").\n\nAlgorithm (Horn-SAT forward chaining)\n- Let T be the set of variables known to be true, initially containing every variable pK that appears as a positive unit clause \"pK is true.\".\n- Repeat:\n  - For each Horn rule clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... or pX is true.\":\n    - If every antecedent variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then add pX to T (if not already present).\n  - For each fully negative clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... .\":\n    - If every variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then a contradiction is forced.\n- Stop when either:\n  - a contradiction is found, or\n  - no new variables can be added to T.\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.\n- If you print derived variables, prefer printing one derived variable per line (e.g., \"p7\").\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np3 is

whether the statements form a logical contradiction (unsatisfiable) or not.\n\nSemantics\n- Propositional variables are written as pN where N is a number.\n- Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nHorn restriction (this suite is run on Horn-only inputs)\n- Every clause is a Horn clause: it contains at most one positive literal (\"pX is true\").\n\nAlgorithm (Horn-SAT forward chaining)\n- Let T be the set of variables known to be true, initially containing every variable pK that appears as a positive unit clause \"pK is true.\".\n- Repeat:\n  - For each Horn rule clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... or pX is true.\":\n    - If every antecedent variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then add pX to T (if not already present).\n  - For each fully negative clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... .\":\n    - If every variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then a contradiction is forced.\n- Stop when either:\n  - a contradiction is found, or\n  - no new variables can be added to T.\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.\n- If you print derived variables, prefer printing one derived variable per line (e.g., \"p7\").\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np1 is

whether the statements form a logical contradiction (unsatisfiable) or not.\n\nSemantics\n- Propositional variables are written as pN where N is a number.\n- Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nHorn restriction (this suite is run on Horn-only inputs)\n- Every clause is a Horn clause: it contains at most one positive literal (\"pX is true\").\n\nAlgorithm (Horn-SAT forward chaining)\n- Let T be the set of variables known to be true, initially containing every variable pK that appears as a positive unit clause \"pK is true.\".\n- Repeat:\n  - For each Horn rule clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... or pX is true.\":\n    - If every antecedent variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then add pX to T (if not already present).\n  - For each fully negative clause of the form \"pA is false or pB is false or ... .\":\n    - If every variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then a contradiction is forced.\n- Stop when either:\n  - a contradiction is found, or\n  - no new variables can be added to T.\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.\n- If you print derived variables, prefer printing one derived variable per line (e.g., \"p7\").\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np2 is
