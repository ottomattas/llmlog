Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np29 is false or p13 is false or p10 is true.\np29 is false or p6 is false or p1

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p13 is false or p6 is true.\np29 is false or p22 is false or p19

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p26 is false or p21 is true.\np30 is false or p17 is false or p5

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p17 is false or p6 is false.\np29 is false or p23 is false or p20

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np16 is false or p26 is true.\np30 is false or p1 is true or p18 is true.\np30 is

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np39 is false or p29 is false or p38 is true.\np38 is false or p10 is true or p33

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np35 is false or p25 is false.\np40 is false or p20 is false or p23 is true.\np39

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np1 is false or p32 is true.\np38 is false or p17 is true or p40 is true.\np37 is

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np34 is false or p21 is true.\np33 is false or p1 is false.\np40 is false or p34

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np40 is false or p38 is false or p6 is false.\np40 is false or p15 is false or p2

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np40 is false or p33 is false or p10 is false.\np39 is false or p19 is false or

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np39 is false or p11 is false.\np26 is false or p23 is false.\np40 is false or p16

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np39 is false or p37 is false or p31 is true.\np37 is false or p21 is false or p4

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np40 is false or p21 is true or p28 is true.\np38 is false or p33 is false or p22

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p32 is false or p10 is false.\np49 is false or p20 is false or

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p43 is false or p26 is true.\np49 is false or p30 is false or p5

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p29 is false or p16 is false.\np50 is false or p20 is false or

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p12 is true or p36 is true.\np49 is false or p47 is false or p3

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p45 is false or p16 is false.\np50 is false or p42 is false or

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np49 is false or p34 is false or p24 is true.\np47 is false or p43 is false or p32

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np14 is true or p42 is true.\np50 is false or p42 is false or p36 is true.\np49 is

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np48 is false or p28 is true or p45 is true.\np46 is false or p20 is false or p17

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np49 is false or p15 is true or p25 is true.\np46 is false or p45 is false or p27

Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np50 is false or p12 is false or p10 is false.\np50 is false or p8 is false or p31

assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no

as CNF clauses in natural language.\n\nSemantics\n- Literals are written as:\n  - \"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np8 is false or p17 is true.\np20 is false

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np21 is false or p8 is true.\np29 is false or p7 is true or p12 is true.\np28 is false or p21 is false or p27 is true.\np28 is false or

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np29 is false or p13 is false or p10 is true.\np29 is false or p6 is false or p1 is false.\np28 is false or p22 is false or p25 is

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p13 is false or p6 is true.\np29 is false or p22 is false or p19 is true.\np29 is false or p21 is false or p6 is

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p16 is false or p2 is true.\np30 is false or p20 is true or p21 is true.\np29 is false or p24 is false or p12 is

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p17 is false or p6 is false.\np29 is false or p23 is false or p20 is true.\np29 is false or p10 is false or p9 is

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np16 is false or p26 is true.\np30 is false or p1 is true or p18 is true.\np30 is false or p6 is true or p18 is true.\np29 is false or p5

\"pN is true\" (positive)\n  - \"pN is false\" (negative)\n- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with \"or\").\n- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nTask\n- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.\n\nAlgorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)\n- Use a standard DPLL procedure:\n  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.\n  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.\n  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.\n  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).\n\nOutput requirements\n- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.\n- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:\n  - \"contradiction\" if unsatisfiable\n  - \"satisfiable\" if satisfiable\n  - \"unknown\" only if you genuinely cannot decide\n\nStatements:\np30 is false or p19 is false or p28 is true.\np30 is false or p7 is true or p26 is true.\np29 is false or p9 is true or p23 is
