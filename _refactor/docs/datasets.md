## Datasets

Datasets are generated by `scripts/generate_problems.py` and are parameterized by a small set of CLI flags.

### Dataset parameters (what they mean)
- **`--seed`**: makes generation deterministic.
- **`--vars`**: number of variables (\(n\)). Legacy defaults start at **3** because `n=1–2` tends to produce toy/repetitive CNFs.
- **`--clens`**: max clause length (\(k\)). Legacy defaults are `[3,4]` (2-SAT is usually too easy; 5-SAT is supported but can be much heavier).
- **`--horn`**: `only` / `no` / `mixed`.
- **`--percase`**: problems per \((n,k,horn)\) case (must be even; the generator attempts a SAT/UNSAT balance).
- **Clause/variable ratio**: chosen from `goodratios` unless overridden (see `docs/problem-generation.md` for details and probe workflow).

### Will document next
- dataset naming convention (vars, lens, per-case, seed, horn/mixed)
- validation vs production sets
- metadata: how to record generation command + git SHA + checksum
- storage policy (what gets committed vs generated)
