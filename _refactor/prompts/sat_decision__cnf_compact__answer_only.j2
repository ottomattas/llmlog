You will be given a propositional logic problem expressed as CNF clauses.

Semantics
- Literals are written as pN (positive) and not(pN) (negative).
- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with "or").
- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Task
- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Answer format
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "contradiction" if the set is unsatisfiable
  - "satisfiable" if the set is satisfiable
  - "unknown" only if you genuinely cannot decide
- Do not output any other words.

Statements:
{{ clauses }}
