Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem expressed as CNF clauses.

Semantics
- Literals are written as pN (positive) and not(pN) (negative).
- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with "or").
- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Task
- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Algorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving)
- Use a standard DPLL procedure:
  - Unit propagation: if a clause becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.
  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.
  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.
  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).

Output requirements
- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace (including branches and backtracking) above the final answer.
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "contradiction" if unsatisfiable
  - "satisfiable" if satisfiable
  - "unknown" only if you genuinely cannot decide

Statements:
{{ clauses }}
