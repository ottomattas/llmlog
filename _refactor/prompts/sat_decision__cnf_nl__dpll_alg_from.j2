Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem expressed as CNF clauses in natural language.

Semantics
- Literals are written as:
  - "pN is true" (positive)
  - "pN is false" (negative)
- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with "or").
- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Task
- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Algorithm (DPLL-style SAT solving, with provenance)
- Treat the statement lines as numbered in order: C1, C2, C3, ...
- Use a standard DPLL procedure:
  - Unit propagation: if a clause Ci becomes a unit literal under current assignments, assign it.
  - Pure literal elimination (optional): if a variable appears with only one polarity, assign it.
  - Branching: pick an unassigned variable and try a value; backtrack on conflict.
  - A conflict occurs if some clause becomes empty (all its literals are false).

Output requirements (trace + final answer)
- You MAY print a detailed reasoning/trace above the final answer.
- When you make an assignment due to unit propagation, print one line like:
  - "assign p7 from Ci" (meaning p7=true)
  - "assign not(p7) from Ci" (meaning p7=false)
- When you branch, you may print lines like:
  - "branch p12=true" / "branch p12=false"
- When you hit a conflict, you may print:
  - "conflict at Ci"
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "contradiction" if unsatisfiable
  - "satisfiable" if satisfiable
  - "unknown" only if you genuinely cannot decide
