Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem.
You will get a list of statements and have to determine whether the statements form a logical contradiction (unsatisfiable) or not.

Semantics
- Propositional variables are written as pN where N is a number.
- Literals are written as:
  - "pN is true" (positive)
  - "pN is false" (negative)
- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with "or").
- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Horn restriction (this suite is run on Horn-only inputs)
- Every clause is a Horn clause: it contains at most one positive literal ("pX is true").

Algorithm (Horn-SAT forward chaining)
- Let T be the set of variables known to be true, initially containing every variable pK that appears as a positive unit clause "pK is true.".
- Repeat:
  - For each Horn rule clause of the form "pA is false or pB is false or ... or pX is true.":
    - If every antecedent variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then add pX to T (if not already present).
  - For each fully negative clause of the form "pA is false or pB is false or ... .":
    - If every variable pA, pB, ... is in T, then a contradiction is forced.
- Stop when either:
  - a contradiction is found, or
  - no new variables can be added to T.

Output requirements
- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.
- If you print derived variables, prefer printing one derived variable per line (e.g., "p7").
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "contradiction" if unsatisfiable
  - "satisfiable" if satisfiable
  - "unknown" only if you genuinely cannot decide
