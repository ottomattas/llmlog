Your task is to solve a propositional logic problem expressed as CNF clauses in natural language.

Semantics
- Literals are written as:
  - "pN is true" (positive)
  - "pN is false" (negative)
- Each line is a clause (a disjunction with "or").
- All clauses are jointly assumed true (conjoined).

Task
- Determine whether the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable) or satisfiable.

Two examples (format: Statements: ... Answer: ...):
Example 1. Statements: p1 is true. p1 is false or p2 is true. p2 is false. Answer: contradiction.
Example 2. Statements: p1 is true. p1 is true or p2 is true. p2 is false. Answer: satisfiable.

Output requirements
- You MAY print a detailed reasoning trace above the final answer.
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "contradiction" if unsatisfiable
  - "satisfiable" if satisfiable
  - "unknown" only if you genuinely cannot decide

Statements:
{{ clauses }}
