You will be given a propositional logic problem expressed as facts and if-then rules.

Semantics
- Facts look like: "p3."
- Rules look like: "if p2 and p5 then p7."
- Treat all statements as jointly true (conjoined).

Task
- Determine whether p0 can be derived from the facts and rules.

Answer format
- Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation:
  - "yes" if p0 is derivable
  - "no" otherwise
- Do not output any other words.

Statements:
{{ clauses }}
