Therefore, `p9` must be false.\nSo, we deduce that `p9` is false.\n\nNow let's use `p9` is false in other statements:\nFrom statement 5: `false` is false or `p1` is false. This means `p1` is false.\nFrom statement 6: `false` is false or `p1` is true. This means `p1` is true.\n\nWe have deduced that `p1` is false and `p1` is true.

For this statement to be true, `\u00acp3` must be true, which means `p3` is false.\nSo, we deduce that `p3` is false.\n\nNow we have:\n`p2` is true.\n`p4` is true.\n`p9` is false.\n`p3` is false.\n\nLet's check other statements with these deductions.\n\nStatement 10: `\u00acp7 \u2228 p3`\nSince `p3` is false, this becomes `\u00acp7 \u2228 false`. For this to be true, `\u00acp7` must be true, so `p7` is false.\nSo, we deduce that `p7` is false.\n\nStatement 20: `\u00acp3 \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2228 p7`\nSince `p3` is false and `p7` is false, this becomes `true \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2228 false`. This statement is always true, regardless of `p1`.\n\nLet's consider statement 5 again: `\u00acp9 \u2228 \u00acp1`.\nSince `p9` is false, `\u00acp9` is true. So, `true \u2228 \u00acp1` is true.

Since `p2` is true, this is `\u00acp6 \u2228 true`, which is always true.\n\nNow consider statements that involve `p2` being false:\nStatement 15: `\u00acp2 \u2228 p8`. Since `p2` is true, `\u00acp2` is false. So, `false \u2228 p8`. This means `p8` must be true.\nSo, we deduce that `p8` is true.\n\nStatement 16: `\u00acp2 \u2228 p10`. Since `p2` is true, `\u00acp2` is false. So, `false \u2228 p10`.

This statement is consistent.\n\nStatement 9: p6 is false or p3 is false.\nSince p3 is True, \"p3 is false\" is False.\nSo, \"p6 is false or False\" must be True. This implies p6 must be False.\np6 = False\n\nStatement 18: p6 is false or p4 is false or p3 is true.\nSince p6 is False, \"p6 is false\" is True.\nSince p3 is True, \"p3 is true\" is True.\nSo, True or p4 is false or True is True. This statement is consistent.\n\nStatement 19: p6 is false or p3 is false or p2 is true.\nSince p6 is False, \"p6 is false\" is True.\nSince p3 is True, \"p3 is false\" is False.\nSo, True or False or p2 is true is True. This statement is consistent.\n\nStatement 5: p9 is false or p3 is true.\nSince p3 is True, \"p3 is true\" is True.\nSo, \"p9 is false or True\" is True.

This statement is consistent regardless of p7's value.\n\nStatement 12: p1 is false or p7 is true.\n\nLet's consider the implications of p7.\nIf p7 is True:\nStatement 7: \"p7 is false\" is False. So, \"False or p1 is true\" implies p1 must be True.\np1 = True\nStatement 12: \"p1 is false\" is False. So, \"False or p7 is true\" implies p7 must be True. This is consistent.\nStatement 6: \"p9 is false or p7 is true\" is True. This is consistent.\nStatement 16: \"p9 is false or p7 is false or p3 is false\". Since p7 is True, \"p7 is false\" is False.

So, \"True or p1 is true\" is True. This is consistent regardless of p1.\nStatement 12: \"p1 is false or p7 is true\". Since p7 is False, \"p7 is true\" is False. So, \"p1 is false or False\" must be True. This implies p1 must be False.\np1 = False\nStatement 6: \"p9 is false or p7 is true\". Since p7 is False, \"p7 is true\" is False. So, \"p9 is false or False\" must be True. This implies p9 must be False.\np9 = False\nStatement 16: \"p9 is false or p7 is false or p3 is false\". Since p9 is False, \"p9 is false\" is True. Since p7 is False, \"p7 is false\" is True. Since p3 is True, \"p3 is false\" is False. So, \"True or True or False\" is True. This statement is consistent.\n\nSo we have two possible scenarios for p1 and p7:\nScenario A: p7 = True, p1 = True, p9 = False\nScenario B: p7 = False, p1 = False, p9 = False\n\nLet's check the remaining statements with these scenarios.\n\nWe know:\np3 = True\np5 = True\np8 = True\np6 = False\n\nScenario A: p7 = True, p1 = True, p9 = False\nStatement 4: p10 is false or p4 is true.\nStatement 13: p10 is false or p4 is false or p1 is false. Since p1 is True, \"p1 is false\" is False. So, \"p10 is false or p4 is false or False\" must be True. This means \"p10 is false or p4 is false\" must be True.\nStatement 14: p10 is false or p1 is false or p2 is true. Since p1 is True, \"p1 is false\" is False. So, \"p10 is false or False or p2 is true\" must be True. This means \"p10 is false or p2 is true\" must be True.\nStatement 15: p10 is false or p1 is false or p7 is true. Since p1 is True, \"p1 is false\" is False. Since p7 is True, \"p7 is true\" is True. So, \"p10 is false or False or True\" is True. This statement is consistent.\nStatement 17: p7 is false or p2 is false or p10 is true. Since p7 is True, \"p7 is false\" is False. So, \"False or p2 is false or p10 is true\" must be True. This means \"p2 is false or p10 is true\" must be True.\nStatement 20: p5 is false or p2 is false or p1 is false. Since p5 is True, \"p5 is false\" is False. Since p1 is True, \"p1 is false\" is False. So, \"False or p2 is false or False\" must be True. This implies p2 must be False.\np2 = False\n\nNow let's check the remaining statements with p2 = False in Scenario A:\nStatement 4: p10 is false or p4 is true.\nStatement 13: \"p10 is false or p4 is false\" must be True.\nStatement 14: \"p10 is false or p2 is true\". Since p2 is False, \"p2 is true\" is False. So, \"p10 is false or False\" must be True. This implies p10 must be False.\np10 = False\n\nNow we have p10 = False. Let's check the remaining statements with p10 = False:\nStatement 4: \"p10 is false\" is True. So, \"True or p4 is true\" is True. Consistent.\nStatement 13: \"p10 is false or p4 is false\". Since p10 is False, \"p10 is false\" is True. So, \"True or p4 is false\" is True. Consistent.\nStatement 17: \"p2 is false or p10 is true\". Since p2 is False, \"p2 is false\" is True. Since p10 is False, \"p10 is true\" is False. So, \"True or False\" is True.
