Do not output any other words.\n\nConventions\n- Propositional variables are written as pN, where N is a number.\n- All statements are jointly assumed true (conjoined).\n\nAnswer format\n- For Horn tasks (style: horn_if_then): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"yes\" if p0 is derivable from the given facts and rules; otherwise \"no\". Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable.
