If such an assignment exists, then p0 is not derivable.\n\nLet's assume p0 is false (p0 = F) and try to satisfy all other statements:\n\n*   From statement 1: p4 must be true (p4 = T).\n\n*   Consider statement 7: p2 or p4. Since p4 = T, this statement is true regardless of the value of p2. So, p2 can be T or F.\n\n*   Consider statement 4: if p3 then p4. Since p4 = T, this statement is true regardless of the value of p3 (T -> T is true, F -> T is true). So, p3 can be T or F.\n\n*   Consider statement 6: if p1 then p4. Since p4 = T, this statement is true regardless of the value of p1 (T -> T is true, F -> T is true). So, p1 can be T or F.\n\nNow, let's look at the rules that conclude p0, assuming p0 = F:\n\n*   Statement 2: if p4 and p1 then p0. Since p0 = F, for this implication to be true, its antecedent (p4 and p1) must be false. We know p4 = T. So, (T and p1) must be false, which implies p1 must be false (p1 = F).\n\n*   Statement 3: if p3 and p1 then p0. Since p0 = F, for this implication to be true, its antecedent (p3 and p1) must be false. We just determined p1 = F. So, (p3 and F) is false, which makes the antecedent false, and thus the implication (F -> F) is true. This statement is satisfied.\n\n*   Statement 5: if p2 and p1 then p0. Since p0 = F, for this implication to be true, its antecedent (p2 and p1) must be false. We know p1 = F. So, (p2 and F) is false, which makes the antecedent false, and thus the implication (F -> F) is true. This statement is satisfied.\n\nWe have found a consistent assignment where p0 is false:\np0 = F\np1 = F\np4 = T\np2 can be F (e.g.)\np3 can be F (e.g.)\n\nLet's verify this assignment:\np0 = F, p1 = F, p2 = F, p3 = F, p4 = T\n\n1.  p4: T (True)\n2.  if p4 and p1 then p0: (T and F) -> F is F -> F (True)\n3.  if p3 and p1 then p0: (F and F) -> F is F -> F (True)\n4.  if p3 then p4: F -> T (True)\n5.  if p2 and p1 then p0: (F and F) -> F is F -> F (True)\n6.  if p1 then p4: F -> T (True)\n7.  p2 or p4: F or T (True)\n\nAll statements are true with p0 being false.
