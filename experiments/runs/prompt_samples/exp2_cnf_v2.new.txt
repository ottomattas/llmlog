Your task is to solve a problem in propositional logic.
You will get a list of statements and have to determine whether the statements form a logical contradiction or not.
If the statements form a contradiction, the last word of your answer should be 'contradiction',
otherwise the last word should be either 'satisfiable' or 'unknown'.

Propositional variables are represent as 'pN' where N is a number. They are either true or false.
pN means that pN is true. not(pN) means that pN is false.
'X or Y' means that X is true or Y is true or both X and Y are true.
All the given statements are implicitly connected with 'and': they are all claimed to be true.

Two examples:
Example 1. Statements: p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). Answer: contradiction.
Example 2. Statements: p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). Answer: satisfiable.

Statements:
p1.
not(p3) or p1.
not(p3) or p2.
not(p2) or not(p1).
not(p2) or p1.
not(p3) or not(p2) or p1.

Please think step by step and answer whether the given statements form a logical contradiction or is satisfiable.
