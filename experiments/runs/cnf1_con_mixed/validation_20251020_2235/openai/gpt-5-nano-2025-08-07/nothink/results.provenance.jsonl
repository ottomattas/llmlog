Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192

Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192 yes\n\nExamples (CNF, contradiction)\n- p1 is true. not(p1) or p2. p2 is false. \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). \u2192 satisfiable.\n\nStatements:\np14 is false or p10 is true.\np12 is false or p10 is false.\np12 is false or p2 is true.\np11 is false or p2 is false.\np7 is false or p6 is true.\np5 is false or p2 is true.\np2 is true or p9 is true.\np6 is true or p10 is true.\np8 is true or p14 is true.\np15 is false or p11 is false or p10 is false.\np15 is false or p9 is false or p6 is false.\np15 is false or p9 is false or p10 is true.\np15 is false or p6 is false or p1 is false.\np15 is false or p4 is true or p14 is true.\np14 is false or p4 is false or p3 is false.\np14 is false or p3 is false or p9 is true.\np14 is false or p2 is true or p12 is true.\np13 is false or p12 is false or p7 is true.\np13 is false or p12 is false or p9 is true.\np13 is false or p10 is false or p14 is true.\np13 is false or p9 is false or p6 is false.\np13 is false or p8 is false or p6 is false.\np13 is false or p8 is false or p12 is true.\np13 is false or p3 is false or p8 is true.\np11 is false or p9 is false or p4 is true.\np11 is false or p4 is false or p1 is false.\np11 is false or p7 is true or p15 is true.\np10 is false or p4 is false or p1 is false.\np10 is false or p3 is false or p4 is true.\np10 is false or p1 is true or p6 is true.\np9 is false or p7 is false or p4 is true.\np9 is false or p2 is true or p7 is true.\np8 is false or p7 is false or p5 is false.\np8 is false or p5 is false or p10 is true.\np8 is false or p3 is false or p15 is true.\np8 is false or p2 is false or p1 is true.\np8 is false or p10 is true or p13 is true.\np7 is false or p4 is false or p15 is true.\np7 is false or p2 is false or p1 is false.\np7 is false or p2 is true or p10 is true.\np7 is false or p6 is true or p12 is true.\np6 is false or p3 is false or p1 is false.\np6 is false or p2 is false or p1 is false.\np6 is false or p1 is true or p10 is true.\np6 is false or p9 is true or p13 is true.\np4 is false or p7 is true or p13 is true.\np3 is false or p4 is true or p13 is true.\np3 is false or p8 is true or p14 is true.\np2 is false or p1 is false or p4 is true.\np2 is false or p7 is true or p8 is true.\np2 is false or p7 is true or p14 is true.\np2 is false or p8 is true or p11 is true.\np1 is false or p12 is true or p14 is true.\np1 is true or p8 is true or p9 is true.\np1 is true or p8 is true or p12 is true.\np1 is true or p12 is true or p15 is true.\np2 is true or p10 is true or p13 is true.\np3 is true or p7 is true or p14 is true.\np4 is true or p8 is true or p13 is true.\np4 is true or p13 is true or p15 is true.\n", "prompt_template": "prompts/_template_unified.j2", "full_text": "", "raw_response": null, "finish_reason": null, "usage": null, "timing_ms": null, "error": "OpenAI error 429 Too Many Requests: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
