Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192
