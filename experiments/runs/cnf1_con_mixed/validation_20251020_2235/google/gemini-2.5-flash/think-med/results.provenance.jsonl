Since `p3` is false, `False or p4 or False`, which implies `p4` is true.\n\nSo, if `p5` is false, we have derived the following unique assignment:\n`p1 = True`\n`p2 = False`\n`p3 = False`\n`p4 = True`\n`p5 = False`\n\nNow, we must check if this assignment satisfies all original clauses. If it satisfies all clauses, the set is satisfiable.

Let's substitute `p2=True` (and `~p2=False`) into the remaining relevant clauses:\n*   From Clause 3: `~True or p1` becomes `False or p1`, which implies `p1` is true.\n*   From Clause 6: `~True or ~p1` becomes `False or ~p1`, which implies `~p1` is true.\n\nWe have derived that `p1` is true AND `p1` is false. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption that `p5` is true leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Case 2: Assume `p5` is false.**\nIf `p5` is false, then `~p5` is true.\nLet's simplify clauses containing `p5` or `~p5`:\n*   Clause 2: `~p3 or p5` becomes `~p3 or False`, which implies `~p3` is true. So, `p3` is false.\n*   Clause 4: `p1 or p5` becomes `p1 or False`, which implies `p1` is true.\n*   Clause 14: `~p2 or ~p1 or p5` becomes `~p2 or ~p1 or False`. Since `p1` is true, `~p1` is false. So, `~p2 or False or False`, which implies `~p2` is true. So, `p2` is false.\n*   Clause 17: `p3 or p4 or p5` becomes `p3 or p4 or False`. Since `p3` is false, `False or p4 or False`, which implies `p4` is true.\n\nSo, if `p5` is false, we have derived the following unique assignment:\n`p1 = True`\n`p2 = False`\n`p3 = False`\n`p4 = True`\n`p5 = False`\n\nNow, we must check if this assignment satisfies all original clauses. If it satisfies all clauses, the set is satisfiable. If it falsifies any clause, then `p5=false` also leads to a contradiction, making the entire set unsatisfiable.\n\nLet's check clause 28: `~p4 or ~p1 or p2 or p3`\nSubstitute the derived truth values:\n`~True or ~True or False or False`\n`False or False or False or False`\nThis evaluates to `False`.\n\nClause 28 is falsified by the assignment `p1=True, p2=False, p3=False, p4=True, p5=False`.\nTherefore, the assumption that `p5` is false leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince both `p5` being true and `p5` being false lead to a contradiction, the set of clauses is unsatisfiable.\n\ncontradiction"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 1138, "candidatesTokenCount": 1532, "totalTokenCount": 10862, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 1138}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 8192}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "JZ72aLWTOJ6y28oP_8POsAQ"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1138, "output_tokens": 1532, "reasoning_tokens": 8192}, "timing_ms": 50654, "error": null}

Let's try assigning a truth value to a variable and see if it leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Assumption 1: Let p6 be true.**\nIf `p6 = true`:\n*   From (1) `not(p6) or not(p5)` becomes `false or not(p5)`, so `not(p5)` must be true. Thus, `p5 = false`.\n*   From (2) `not(p6) or not(p1)` becomes `false or not(p1)`, so `not(p1)` must be true. Thus, `p1 = false`.\n*   From (3) `not(p6) or p3` becomes `false or p3`, so `p3` must be true. Thus, `p3 = true`.\n*   From (14) `not(p6) or not(p3) or p7` becomes `false or not(true) or p7`, which simplifies to `false or false or p7`, so `p7` must be true. Thus, `p7 = true`.\n*   From (17) `not(p6) or p2 or p5` becomes `false or p2 or false`, so `p2` must be true. Thus, `p2 = true`.\n\nSo far, if `p6 = true`, we have:\n`p1 = false`\n`p2 = true`\n`p3 = true`\n`p5 = false`\n`p6 = true`\n`p7 = true`\n\nNow, let's check other clauses with these assignments.\n*   Consider clause (7): `not(p7) or not(p4) or not(p2)`\n    Substitute values: `not(true) or not(p4) or not(true)`\n    This simplifies to `false or not(p4) or false`, which means `not(p4)` must be true. Thus, `p4 = false`.\n\nNow we have:\n`p1 = false`\n`p2 = true`\n`p3 = true`\n`p4 = false`\n`p5 = false`\n`p6 = true`\n`p7 = true`\n\nLet's check clause (13): `not(p7) or p4 or p5`\nSubstitute values: `not(true) or false or false`\nThis simplifies to `false or false or false`, which is `false`.\nThis is a contradiction!\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that `p6 = true` leads to a contradiction. This means `p6` must be `false`.\n\n**Deduction 1: p6 = false.**\nNow, let's simplify the clauses with `p6 = false`.\nClauses containing `not(p6)` are satisfied. Clauses containing `p6` simplify.\n\n*   (18) `not(p5) or not(p1) or p6` becomes `not(p5) or not(p1) or false` -> `not(p5) or not(p1)`\n*   (19) `not(p5) or p1 or p6` becomes `not(p5) or p1 or false` -> `not(p5) or p1`\n\nFrom `(not(p5) or not(p1))` and `(not(p5) or p1)`, we can resolve `p1` and `not(p1)` to get `not(p5)`.\nThus, `p5 = false`.\n\n**Deduction 2: p5 = false.**\nNow we have `p6 = false` and `p5 = false`. Let's simplify further.\n\n*   From (5) `p3 or p5` becomes `p3 or false`, so `p3` must be true. Thus, `p3 = true`.\n*   From (28) `p4 or p5 or p6` becomes `p4 or false or false`, so `p4` must be true. Thus, `p4 = true`.\n\n**Deduction 3: p3 = true and p4 = true.**\nNow we have `p6 = false`, `p5 = false`, `p3 = true`, `p4 = true`. Let's simplify further.\n\n*   From (21) `not(p4) or not(p3) or not(p2)` becomes `not(true) or not(true) or not(p2)`\n    This simplifies to `false or false or not(p2)`, so `not(p2)` must be true. Thus, `p2 = false`.\n\n**Deduction 4: p2 = false.**\nNow we have `p6 = false`, `p5 = false`, `p3 = true`, `p4 = true`, `p2 = false`. Let's simplify further.\n\n*   From (4) `p1 or p2` becomes `p1 or false`, so `p1` must be true.

We need to pay close attention to clauses where all literals might evaluate to false.\n\nLet's check clause (22): \u00acp4 \u2228 \u00acp2 \u2228 p8\nSubstitute the derived values:\n\u00ac(True) \u2228 \u00ac(True) \u2228 False\nFalse \u2228 False \u2228 False\nFalse\n\nClause (22) evaluates to False under the derived assignment. Since all clauses must be true for a satisfying assignment, and we found one clause that is false, this means the set of clauses is unsatisfiable.\n\nTherefore, the set of statements is a contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{contradiction}$"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 902, "candidatesTokenCount": 1426, "totalTokenCount": 9693, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 902}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 7365}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "N732aMymJNy9xN8P44Oc-AQ"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 902, "output_tokens": 1426, "reasoning_tokens": 7365}, "timing_ms": 42284, "error": null}

Let's propagate `not(p8) = True`:\n    *   (3) `True or not(p4)` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (4) `True or p1` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (5) `True or p4` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (11) `not(p5) or False` -> `not(p5)` must be true. So, `p5` is false.\n\n*   So far: `p1 = True`, `p8 = False`, `p5 = False`.\n\n*   Consider clauses (7), (8), (9), (10) involving `p6`:\n    *   (7) `not(p6) or not(p3)`\n    *   (8) `not(p6) or p2`\n    *   (9) `not(p6) or p4`\n    *   (10) `not(p6) or p7`\n    If `p6` were true, then `not(p6)` would be false. This would imply:\n    *   From (7): `not(p3)` (so `p3 = False`)\n    *   From (8): `p2` (so `p2 = True`)\n    *   From (9): `p4` (so `p4 = True`)\n    *   From (10): `p7` (so `p7 = True`)\n    Let's check these implications with other clauses:\n    *   Clause (2): `not(p10) or not(p4)`. Since `p4 = True`, this becomes `not(p10) or False`, which implies `not(p10)` (so `p10 = False`).\n    *   Clause (6): `not(p7) or p10`. Since `p7 = True`, this becomes `not(True) or p10`, which implies `False or p10`, so `p10` must be true.\n    We have a contradiction: `p10 = False` and `p10 = True`.\n    Therefore, our assumption `p6 = True` must be false.\n    So, `p6` must be false. (`not(p6)` is true).\n\n*   Now we have `p1 = True`, `p8 = False`, `p5 = False`, `p6 = False`. Let's propagate `not(p6) = True`:\n    *   (7) `True or not(p3)` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (8) `True or p2` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (9) `True or p4` -> True (satisfied)\n    *   (10) `True or p7` -> True (satisfied)\n\n**Step 2: Remaining Clauses and Finding a Satisfying Assignment**\n\nAt this point, we have determined the truth values for `p1`, `p8`, `p5`, and `p6`:\n`p1 = True`\n`p8 = False`\n`p5 = False`\n`p6 = False`\n\nThe clauses that are not yet trivially satisfied by these assignments are:\n*   (2) `not(p10) or not(p4)`\n*   (6) `not(p7) or p10`\n*   (12) `not(p4) or not(p2)`\n*   (13) `not(p3) or p5`\n\nLet's use the known `p5 = False` in clause (13):\n*   (13) `not(p3) or False` -> `not(p3)` must be true. So, `p3` is false.\n\nNow we have:\n`p1 = True`\n`p8 = False`\n`p5 = False`\n`p6 = False`\n`p3 = False`\n\nRemaining clauses to satisfy:\n*   (2) `not(p10) or not(p4)`\n*   (6) `not(p7) or p10`\n*   (12) `not(p4) or not(p2)`\n\nLet's try to assign a value to `p4`.\n\n**Case: `p4 = True`**\n*   From (2): `not(p10) or not(True)` -> `not(p10) or False` -> `not(p10)` must be true. So, `p10 = False`.\n*   From (12): `not(True) or not(p2)` -> `False or not(p2)` -> `not(p2)` must be true. So, `p2 = False`.\n*   From (6): `not(p7) or p10`. Since `p10 = False`, this becomes `not(p7) or False` -> `not(p7)` must be true. So, `p7 = False`.\n\nThis gives us a complete assignment:\n`p1 = True`\n`p2 = False`\n`p3 = False`\n`p4 = True`\n`p5 = False`\n`p6 = False`\n`p7 = False`\n`p8 = False`\n`p10 = False`\n\nLet's verify this assignment against all original clauses:\n1.  `p1` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n2.  `not(p10) or not(p4)` -> `not(False) or not(True)` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n3.  `not(p8) or not(p4)` -> `not(False) or not(True)` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n4.  `not(p8) or p1` -> `not(False) or True` -> `True or True` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n5.  `not(p8) or p4` -> `not(False) or True` -> `True or True` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n6.  `not(p7) or p10` -> `not(False) or False` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n7.  `not(p6) or not(p3)` -> `not(False) or not(False)` -> `True or True` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n8.  `not(p6) or p2` -> `not(False) or False` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n9.  `not(p6) or p4` -> `not(False) or True` -> `True or True` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n10. `not(p6) or p7` -> `not(False) or False` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n11. `not(p5) or p8` -> `not(False) or False` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n12. `not(p4) or not(p2)` -> `not(True) or not(False)` -> `False or True` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n13. `not(p3) or p5` -> `not(False) or False` -> `True or False` -> `True` (Satisfied)\n\nAll clauses are satisfied by this assignment.

From `C4: -p8 or p11`: `-False or p11` implies `True or p11`. This clause is satisfied by `p8 = False`, and `p11` is not forced by this clause. However, we already derived `p11 = False` from `C1` and `C5`. Let's check consistency: `True or False` is `True`. This is consistent.\n\nSo far, we have `p8 = False`, `p5 = True`, `p11 = False`.\nLet's continue propagating these values:\n*   From `C2: -p11 or p7`: `-False or p7` implies `True or p7`. This clause is satisfied. `p7` is not forced.\n*   From `C3: -p8 or p6`: `-False or p6` implies `True or p6`. This clause is satisfied. `p6` is not forced.\n\nWe need to find a contradiction. Let's look for other clauses that become unit clauses or false.\nConsider clause (34): `-p7 or p3 or p11`.\nWe have `p11 = False`. So, `-p7 or p3 or False` simplifies to `-p7 or p3`.\nConsider clause (33): `-p8 or p3 or p11`.\nWe have `p8 = False` and `p11 = False`. So, `-False or p3 or False` simplifies to `True or p3 or False`, which is `True`. This clause is satisfied.\n\nLet's use resolution to derive a contradiction from the initial set of clauses.\nConsider the following clauses:\nC1:  `-p11 or -p5`\nC2:  `-p11 or p7`\nC3:  `-p8 or p6`\nC4:  `-p8 or p11`\nC5:  `p5 or p8`\nC32: `-p8 or -p7 or -p6`\n\n1.

Resolve R1 (`p5 or p11`) and C1 (`-p11 or -p5`) on `p11`:\n    Result: `p5 or -p5` (This is a tautology, `True`. This means `p5` and `p11` must have opposite truth values, but it doesn't lead to a contradiction directly.)\n\nMy previous DPLL trace was correct.

(This clause is satisfied, no contradiction here).\n\nLet's continue with the derived assignments: `p8 = False`, `p5 = True`, `p11 = False`.\n*   From clause (2) `-p11 or p7`: Since `p11` is False, `-p11` is True. This clause is satisfied, and `p7` is not forced.\n*   From clause (3) `-p8 or p6`: Since `p8` is False, `-p8` is True. This clause is satisfied, and `p6` is not forced.\n\nWe need to find a contradiction. Let's look at clause (32) `-p8 or -p7 or -p6`.\nWe know `p8 = False`, so `-p8` is True. This clause is satisfied.\n\nMy previous trace had an error in the `p8=False` path. Let's re-examine the clauses that led to a contradiction in the thought process.\n\nThe contradiction in the `p8=False` path was:\n`p8=F, p5=T, p11=T` (error here, p11 should be F from C1)\n`C1: -p11 -p5`\n`C4: -p8 p11`\n`C5: p5 p8`\n\nLet's re-do the `p8=False` path carefully:\n1. Assume `p8 = False`.\n2. From `C5: p5 or p8`: `p5 or False` implies `p5 = True`.\n3. From `C1: -p11 or -p5`: `-p11 or -True` implies `-p11 or False`, which means `-p11 = True`, so `p11 = False`.\n4. From `C4: -p8 or p11`: `-False or p11` implies `True or p11`. This clause is satisfied by `p8 = False`, and `p11` is not forced by this clause. However, we already derived `p11 = False` from `C1` and `C5`. Let's check consistency: `True or False` is `True`. This is consistent.\n\nSo far, we have `p8 = False`, `p5 = True`, `p11 = False`.\nLet's continue propagating these values:\n*   From `C2: -p11 or p7`: `-False or p7` implies `True or p7`. This clause is satisfied. `p7` is not forced.\n*   From `C3: -p8 or p6`: `-False or p6` implies `True or p6`. This clause is satisfied. `p6` is not forced.\n\nWe need to find a contradiction. Let's look for other clauses that become unit clauses or false.\nConsider clause (34): `-p7 or p3 or p11`.\nWe have `p11 = False`. So, `-p7 or p3 or False` simplifies to `-p7 or p3`.\nConsider clause (33): `-p8 or p3 or p11`.\nWe have `p8 = False` and `p11 = False`. So, `-False or p3 or False` simplifies to `True or p3 or False`, which is `True`. This clause is satisfied.\n\nLet's use resolution to derive a contradiction from the initial set of clauses.\nConsider the following clauses:\nC1:  `-p11 or -p5`\nC2:  `-p11 or p7`\nC3:  `-p8 or p6`\nC4:  `-p8 or p11`\nC5:  `p5 or p8`\nC32: `-p8 or -p7 or -p6`\n\n1.  Resolve C4 (`-p8 or p11`) and C5 (`p5 or p8`) on `p8`:\n    Result: `p5 or p11` (Let's call this R1)\n\n2.  Resolve R1 (`p5 or p11`) and C1 (`-p11 or -p5`) on `p11`:\n    Result: `p5 or -p5` (This is a tautology, `True`. This means `p5` and `p11` must have opposite truth values, but it doesn't lead to a contradiction directly.)\n\nMy previous DPLL trace was correct. Let's re-verify the first contradiction (p8=True) carefully.\n\n**Case 1: Assume `p8` is True**\n1.  `p8 = True`\n2.  From C4 (`-p8 or p11`): `-True or p11` -> `False or p11` -> `p11 = True`.\n3.  From C3 (`-p8 or p6`): `-True or p6` -> `False or p6` -> `p6 = True`.\n4.

Let's look at the binary clauses that resulted:\n(3') `-p9 or -p5`\n(4') `p2 or p5`\n(5') `p3 or p9`\n(10') `-p11 or p3`\n(26') `p7 or p11`\n(27') `p8 or p11`\n\nFrom (3') and (4'): Resolve on `p5` -> `-p9 or p2` (C_A)\nFrom (3') and (5'): Resolve on `p9` -> `-p5 or p3` (C_B)\n\nLet's try to satisfy these binary clauses:\nAssume `p5 = True`.\nFrom (3'): `-p9` -> `p9 = False`\nFrom (4'): `p2` -> `p2 = True`\nFrom (5'): `p3` -> `p3 = True`\nFrom (10'): `-p11 or T` -> `True` (satisfied)\nFrom (26'): `p7 or p11`\nFrom (27'): `p8 or p11`\n\nSo far: `p13=F, p5=T, p9=F, p2=T, p3=T`.\n\nLet's continue with the remaining binary clauses:\n(26') `p7 or p11`\n(27') `p8 or p11`\n\nLet's try `p11 = False`.\nFrom (26'): `p7` -> `p7 = True`\nFrom (27'): `p8` -> `p8 = True`\n\nSo far: `p13=F, p5=T, p9=F, p2=T, p3=T, p11=F, p7=T, p8=T`.\n\nLet's check the remaining clauses with these assignments.\nVariables assigned:\n`p2 = T`\n`p3 = T`\n`p5 = T`\n`p7 = T`\n`p8 = T`\n`p9 = F`\n`p11 = F`\n`p13 = F`\n\nVariables unassigned: `p1, p4, p6, p10, p12`.\n\nLet's check all original clauses with these assignments. If a clause is satisfied, we mark it. If it becomes a unit clause, we propagate. If it becomes empty, we have a contradiction.\n\n1.  `-p12 or -p7` -> `-p12 or F` -> `-p12` (Unit clause: `p12 = F`)\n2.  `-p10 or -p3` -> `-p10 or F` -> `-p10` (Unit clause: `p10 = F`)\n3.  `-p13 or -p9 or -p5` -> `T or T or F` -> `T` (satisfied)\n4.  `-p13 or p2 or p5` -> `T or T or T` -> `T` (satisfied)\n5.  `-p13 or p3 or p9` -> `T or T or F` -> `T` (satisfied)\n6.  `-p12 or -p11 or -p9` -> `-p12 or T or T` -> `T` (satisfied)\n7.  `-p12 or -p5 or -p2` -> `-p12 or F or F` -> `-p12` (Unit clause"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "MAX_TOKENS", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 2470, "candidatesTokenCount": 1806, "totalTokenCount": 12468, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 2470}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 8192}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "Sgn3aJ76F9y9xN8P44Oc-AQ"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 2470, "output_tokens": 1806, "reasoning_tokens": 8192}, "timing_ms": 49628, "error": null}

Now we have:\n    *   C_A: `not(p2) or p7`\n    *   C_E: `not(p7) or p5`\n    *   And we know `p2 <-> p5`.\n\n    Substitute `p5` with `p2` (since `p2 <-> p5`) into C_E:\n    `not(p7) or p2`.\n\n    Now we have two clauses:\n    *   `not(p2) or p7` (C_A)\n    *   `not(p7) or p2` (C_E, after substitution)\n\n    These two clauses are `(p2 -> p7)` and `(p7 -> p2)`. Together, they imply `p2 <-> p7`.\n\n7.  So far, we have derived:\n    *   `p13 = True`\n    *   `p11 = True`\n    *   `p2 <-> p5`\n    *   `p2 <-> p7` (which also means `p5 <-> p7`)\n\n    This means `p2`, `p5`, and `p7` must all have the same truth value.\n\n8.  Let's look at clause `C_C: not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p7)`.\n    And clause `p8 is false or p7 is false or p11 is true.` (`not(p8) or not(p7) or p11`).\n    Since `p11 = True`, this clause is satisfied: `not(p8) or not(p7) or True`.\n\n    Let's re-examine the clauses.\n\n    Consider the clause: `p11 is false or p9 is false or p8 is false or p7 is false.`\n    This is `not(p11) or not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p7)`.\n    Since `p11 = True`, `not(p11)` is `False`.\n    So, the clause simplifies to `not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p7)`.\n\n    If `p2 = True`, then `p5 = True` and `p7 = True`.\n    If `p7 = True`, then `not(p7)` is `False`.\n    The clause `not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p7)` becomes `not(p9) or not(p8) or False`, which simplifies to `not(p9) or not(p8)`.\n    This means `p9` and `p8` cannot both be true.\n\n    Let's try to find a contradiction by assuming a value for `p2`.\n\n    **Case 1: Assume p2 = True.**\n    *   Then `p5 = True` (from `p2 <-> p5`)\n    *   Then `p7 = True` (from `p2 <-> p7`)\n\n    Now, let's check clauses with `p7 = True`:\n    *   `not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p7)` becomes `not(p9) or not(p8) or False`, so `not(p9) or not(p8)`. (This means `p9` and `p8` cannot both be true).\n    *   `p7 is false or p6 is true.` (`not(p7) or p6`) becomes `False or p6`, so `p6 = True`.\n    *   `p7 is false or p10 is true.` (`not(p7) or p10`) becomes `False or p10`, so `p10 = True`.\n    *   `p7 is false or p12 is true.` (`not(p7) or p12`) becomes `False or p12`, so `p12 = True`.\n\n    So, if `p2=True`, then `p5=True`, `p7=True`, `p6=True`, `p10=True`, `p12=True`.\n    And `not(p9) or not(p8)`.\n\n    Let's check other clauses with these assignments:\n    *   `p12 is false or p8 is true.` (`not(p12) or p8`) becomes `False or p8`, so `p8 = True`.\n    *   But we have `not(p9) or not(p8)`. If `p8 = True`, then `not(p9) or False`, so `not(p9)`. This means `p9 = False`.\n\n    So, if `p2=True`, we get:\n    `p13=T, p11=T, p2=T, p5=T, p7=T, p6=T"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "MAX_TOKENS", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 1460, "candidatesTokenCount": 1806, "totalTokenCount": 11458, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 1460}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 8192}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "_wz3aNS0BfHjnsEPt-mIuQk"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1460, "output_tokens": 1806, "reasoning_tokens": 8192}, "timing_ms": 58570, "error": null}

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192 yes\n\nExamples (CNF, contradiction)\n- p1 is true. not(p1) or p2. p2 is false. \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). \u2192
