For the clause to be true, `\u00acp2` must be true, which means `p2` must be false.\n\n3.

Now, we propagate these values:\n    -   From clause 9 (`not(p17) or not(p16)`) and `p17` = true, we deduce `not(p16)` must be true. So, `p16` = false.\n    -   From clause 18 (`not(p11) or not(p7)`) and `p11` = true, we deduce `not(p7)` must be true. So, `p7` = false.\n    -   From clause 19 (`not(p11) or p1`) and `p11` = true, we deduce `p1` must be true.\n    -   From clause 24 (`not(p2) or not(p1)`) and `p1` = true, we deduce `not(p2)` must be true. So, `p2` = false.\n    -   From clause 23 (`not(p3) or p16`) and `p16` = false, we deduce `not(p3)` must be true. So, `p3` = false.\n\nAt this point, we have determined the following truth values without any contradiction:\n- `p1` = true\n- `p2` = false\n- `p3` = false\n- `p4` = true\n- `p5` = true\n- `p6` = true\n- `p7` = false\n- `p9` = true\n- `p11` = true\n- `p16` = false\n- `p17` = true\n\nLet's check which clauses are now satisfied.

Do not output any other words (do not output \"contradiction\"/\"satisfiable\"/\"unknown\").\n- For CNF contradiction tasks (styles: cnf_v1 or cnf_v2): Output exactly one final word on the last line, lowercase with no punctuation: \"contradiction\" if the set is a contradiction (unsatisfiable); otherwise \"satisfiable\", or \"unknown\" if undecidable. Do not output any other words (do not output \"yes\"/\"no\").\n\nExamples (Horn, yes/no)\n- p1. if p1 then p0. \u2192 yes\n- p1. if p1 then p9. \u2192 no\n- p1. if p1 then p2. if p2 then p0. \u2192 yes\n\nExamples (CNF, contradiction)\n- p1 is true. not(p1) or p2. p2 is false. \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. not(p1) or p2. not(p2). \u2192 contradiction.\n- p1. p1 or p2. not(p2). \u2192 satisfiable.\n\nStatements:\np6 is true.\np11 is true.\np16 is true.\np17 is true.\np20 is false or p2 is true.\np20 is false or p10 is true.\np20 is false or p14 is true.\np19 is false or p9 is true.\np18 is false or p2 is true.\np16 is false or p11 is true.\np15 is false or p14 is true.\np15 is false or p17 is true.\np14 is false or p19 is true.\np12 is false or p8 is true.\np11 is false or p8 is true.\np9 is false or p1 is true.\np9 is false or p15 is true.\np8 is false or p4 is true.\np8 is false or p12 is true.\np7 is false or p1 is true.\np6 is false or p11 is true.\np3 is false or p2 is true.\np2 is false or p14 is true.\np2 is false or p18 is true.\np2 is false or p19 is true.\np20 is false or p10 is false or p7 is true.\np20 is false or p3 is false or p13 is true.\np19 is false or p8 is false or p18 is true.\np18 is false or p9 is false or p3 is true.\np17 is false or p11 is false or p10 is true.\np17 is false or p10 is false or p14 is true.\np16 is false or p14 is false or p3 is true.\np16 is false or p10 is false or p13 is true.\np15 is false or p11 is false or p19 is true.\np15 is false or p9 is false or p10 is true.\np15 is false or p6 is false or p4 is true.\np15 is false or p5 is false or p6 is true.\np14 is false or p12 is false or p4 is true.\np14 is false or p9 is false or p20 is true.\np14 is false or p6 is false or p9 is true.\np14 is false or p5 is false or p16 is true.\np14 is false or p4 is false or p11 is true.\np14 is false or p2 is false or p1 is true.\np12 is false or p9 is false or p17 is true.\np12 is false or p2 is false or p11 is true.\np11 is false or p7 is false or p8 is true.\np11 is false or p7 is false or p16 is true.\np11 is false or p5 is false or p7 is true.\np11 is false or p3 is false or p13 is true.\np10 is false or p5 is false or p4 is true.\np10 is false or p2 is false or p18 is true.\np10 is false or p1 is false or p16 is true.\np9 is false or p1 is false or p15 is true.\np8 is false or p4 is false or p3 is true.\np8 is false or p1 is false or p4 is true.\np6 is false or p4 is false or p18 is true.\np4 is false or p2 is false or p3 is true.\np20 is false or p16 is false or p14 is false or p10 is true.\np20 is false or p15 is false or p14 is false or p16 is true.\np20 is false or p12 is false or p8 is false or p4 is true.\np19 is false or p5 is false or p4 is false or p16 is true.\np18 is false or p16 is false or p15 is false or p13 is true.\np18 is false or p15 is false or p9 is false or p4 is false.\np18 is false or p15 is false or p7 is false or p13 is true.\np18 is false or p11 is false or p5 is false or p4 is true.\np17 is false or p16 is false or p9 is false or p13 is true.\np17 is false or p13 is false or p2 is false or p10 is true.\np17 is false or p13 is false or p1 is false or p4 is true.\np17 is false or p9 is false or p6 is false or p14 is true.\np16 is false or p14 is false or p3 is false or p18 is true.\np16 is false or p9 is false or p4 is false or p19 is true.\np16 is false or p2 is false or p1 is false or p17 is true.\np15 is false or p10 is false or p6 is false or p20 is true.\np15 is false or p9 is false or p3 is false or p10 is true.\np14 is false or p12 is false or p4 is false or p1 is true.\np14 is false or p10 is false or p8 is false or p1 is true.\np14 is false or p8 is false or p2 is false or p10 is true.\np13 is false or p11 is false or p1 is false or p17 is true.\np12 is false or p9 is false or p8 is false or p18 is true.\np12 is false or p7 is false or p3 is false or p2 is false.\np10 is false or p8 is false or p7 is false or p18 is true.\np6 is false or p4 is false or p3 is false or p20 is true.\np20 is false or p17 is false or p14 is false or p8 is false or p19 is true.\np19 is false or p17 is false or p12 is false or p2 is false or p10 is true.\np18 is false or p17 is false or p16 is false or p6 is false or p10 is true.\np17 is false or p12 is false or p10 is false or p6 is false or p19 is true.\np17 is false or p12 is false or p10 is false or p1 is false or p2 is true.\np16 is false or p15 is false or p10 is false or p1 is false or p9 is true.\np16 is false or p9 is false or p4 is false or p3 is false or p13 is true.\np14 is false or p12 is false or p7 is false or p5 is false or p20 is true.\np13 is false or p10 is false or p4 is false or p1 is false or p8 is true.\np8 is false or p7 is false or p3 is false or p1 is false or p17 is true.\n", "prompt_template": "prompts/_template_unified.j2", "full_text": "", "raw_response": null, "finish_reason": null, "usage": null, "timing_ms": null, "error": "Remote end closed connection without response"}
