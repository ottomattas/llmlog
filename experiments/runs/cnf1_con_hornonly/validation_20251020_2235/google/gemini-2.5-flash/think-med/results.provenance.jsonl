The statements are in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form).\n\nLet's convert the statements into standard CNF clauses:\n1.  `p5 is true.` -> `p5`\n2.  `p8 is false or p4 is false.` -> `not(p8) or not(p4)`\n3.  `p7 is false or p4 is false.` -> `not(p7) or not(p4)`\n4.  `p6 is false or p1 is true.` -> `not(p6) or p1`\n5.  `p6 is false or p2 is true.` -> `not(p6) or p2`\n6.  `p6 is false or p3 is true.` -> `not(p6) or p3`\n7.  `p6 is false or p7 is true.` -> `not(p6) or p7`\n8.  `p5 is false or p2 is true.` -> `not(p5) or p2`\n9.  `p3 is false or p6 is true.` -> `not(p3) or p6`\n10. `p8 is false or p4 is false or p1 is true.` -> `not(p8) or not(p4) or p1`\n11. `p8 is false or p2 is false or p5 is true.` -> `not(p8) or not(p2) or p5`\n12. `p8 is false or p1 is false or p5 is true.` -> `not(p8) or not(p1) or p5`\n13. `p8 is false or p1 is false or p7 is true.` -> `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7`\n14. `p7 is false or p3 is false or p4 is true.` -> `not(p7) or not(p3) or p4`\n15. `p6 is false or p4 is false or p1 is true.` -> `not(p6) or not(p4) or p1`\n16. `p6 is false or p3 is false or p2 is false.` -> `not(p6) or not(p3) or not(p2)`\n\nWe will use unit propagation and resolution to find a satisfying assignment or derive a contradiction.\n\n**Step 1: Unit Propagation for `p5`**\nFrom clause 1: `p5` is true.\n-   Clause 8: `not(p5) or p2` becomes `false or p2`, which simplifies to `p2`. So, `p2` is true.\n-   Clause 11: `not(p8) or not(p2) or p5` becomes `not(p8) or not(p2) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 12: `not(p8) or not(p1) or p5` becomes `not(p8) or not(p1) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n\n**Step 2: Unit Propagation for `p2`**\nFrom the new unit `p2`: `p2` is true.\n-   Clause 5: `not(p6) or p2` becomes `not(p6) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 16: `not(p6) or not(p3) or not(p2)` becomes `not(p6) or not(p3) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p6) or not(p3)`.\n\n**Step 3: Resolution**\nWe have clause 9: `not(p3) or p6` and the simplified clause 16': `not(p6) or not(p3)`.\nResolving these two clauses on `p6`: `(not(p3) or p6)` and `(not(p6) or not(p3))` yields `not(p3) or not(p3)`, which simplifies to `not(p3)`. So, `p3` is false.\n\n**Step 4: Unit Propagation for `not(p3)`**\nFrom the new unit `not(p3)`: `p3` is false.\n-   Clause 6: `not(p6) or p3` becomes `not(p6) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p6)`. So, `p6` is false.\n-   Clause 9: `not(p3) or p6` becomes `true or p6`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 14: `not(p7) or not(p3) or p4` becomes `not(p7) or true or p4`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 16': `not(p6) or not(p3)` becomes `not(p6) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n\n**Step 5: Unit Propagation for `not(p6)`**\nFrom the new unit `not(p6)`: `p6` is false.\n-   Clause 4: `not(p6) or p1` becomes `true or p1`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 7: `not(p6) or p7` becomes `true or p7`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 15: `not(p6) or not(p4) or p1` becomes `true or not(p4) or p1`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n\n**Current state of assignments:**\n`p5 = true`\n`p2 = true`\n`p3 = false`\n`p6 = false`\n\n**Remaining clauses:**\n2.  `not(p8) or not(p4)`\n3.  `not(p7) or not(p4)`\n10. `not(p8) or not(p4) or p1`\n13. `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7`\n\nNotice that clause 10 (`not(p8) or not(p4) or p1`) is a superset of clause 2 (`not(p8) or not(p4)`). If clause 2 is true, then clause 10 is also true. So, clause 10 is redundant and can be removed.\n\n**Remaining clauses (simplified):**\n2.  `not(p8) or not(p4)`\n3.  `not(p7) or not(p4)`\n13. `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7`\n\nNo more unit clauses. Let's try assigning a value to `p4`.\n\n**Step 6: Branching - Assume `p4 = true`**\n-   Clause 2: `not(p8) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p8) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p8)`. So, `p8` is false.\n-   Clause 3: `not(p7) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p7) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p7)`. So, `p7` is false.\n\nNow substitute these into the last remaining clause:\n-   Clause 13: `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7` becomes `true or not(p1) or false`, which simplifies to `true or not(p1)`.

So, `p2` is true.\n-   Clause 11: `not(p8) or not(p2) or p5` becomes `not(p8) or not(p2) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 12: `not(p8) or not(p1) or p5` becomes `not(p8) or not(p1) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n\n**Step 2: Unit Propagation for `p2`**\nFrom the new unit `p2`: `p2` is true.\n-   Clause 5: `not(p6) or p2` becomes `not(p6) or true`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 16: `not(p6) or not(p3) or not(p2)` becomes `not(p6) or not(p3) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p6) or not(p3)`.\n\n**Step 3: Resolution**\nWe have clause 9: `not(p3) or p6` and the simplified clause 16': `not(p6) or not(p3)`.\nResolving these two clauses on `p6`: `(not(p3) or p6)` and `(not(p6) or not(p3))` yields `not(p3) or not(p3)`, which simplifies to `not(p3)`. So, `p3` is false.\n\n**Step 4: Unit Propagation for `not(p3)`**\nFrom the new unit `not(p3)`: `p3` is false.\n-   Clause 6: `not(p6) or p3` becomes `not(p6) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p6)`. So, `p6` is false.\n-   Clause 9: `not(p3) or p6` becomes `true or p6`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 14: `not(p7) or not(p3) or p4` becomes `not(p7) or true or p4`, which is satisfied.

Remove.\n-   Clause 7: `not(p6) or p7` becomes `true or p7`, which is satisfied. Remove.\n-   Clause 15: `not(p6) or not(p4) or p1` becomes `true or not(p4) or p1`, which is satisfied.

If clause 2 is true, then clause 10 is also true. So, clause 10 is redundant and can be removed.\n\n**Remaining clauses (simplified):**\n2.  `not(p8) or not(p4)`\n3.  `not(p7) or not(p4)`\n13. `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7`\n\nNo more unit clauses. Let's try assigning a value to `p4`.\n\n**Step 6: Branching - Assume `p4 = true`**\n-   Clause 2: `not(p8) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p8) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p8)`. So, `p8` is false.\n-   Clause 3: `not(p7) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p7) or false`, which simplifies to `not(p7)`. So, `p7` is false.\n\nNow substitute these into the last remaining clause:\n-   Clause 13: `not(p8) or not(p1) or p7` becomes `true or not(p1) or false`, which simplifies to `true or not(p1)`. This clause is satisfied regardless of `p1`.\n\nWe have found a consistent assignment:\n`p1` can be true or false (let's pick `p1 = true`)\n`p2 = true`\n`p3 = false`\n`p4 = true`\n`p5 = true`\n`p6 = false`\n`p7 = false`\n`p8 = false`\n\nThis assignment satisfies all original clauses.

Since `p2` is true, this clause is satisfied.\n*   Clause 14: `not(p10) or not(p3) or not(p2)`. Since `p2` is true, `not(p2)` is false. Thus, `not(p10) or not(p3)` must be true.\n*   Clause 18: `not(p7) or not(p4) or p2`. Since `p2` is true, this clause is satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Propagate `p4`**\n*   Clause 7: `not(p5) or not(p4)`. Since `p4` is true, `not(p4)` is false. Thus, `not(p5)` must be true.\n    *   Derived: `not(p5)`\n*   Clause 10: `not(p4) or p6`. Since `p4` is true, `not(p4)` is false. Thus, `p6` must be true.\n    *   Derived: `p6`\n*   Clause 17: `not(p8) or not(p4) or p3`. Since `p4` is true, `not(p4)` is false.

From clause (2), we know `p3` is true.\n\nNow, propagate these assignments:\n\n*   Using `p1 = true`:\n    *   Clause (14): `not(p1) or p5` becomes `false or p5`. For this to be true, `p5` must be true. So, `p5 = true`.\n    *   Clause (15): `not(p1) or p6` becomes `false or p6`. For this to be true, `p6` must be true. So, `p6 = true`.\n\n*   Using `p3 = true`:\n    *   Clause (10): `not(p4) or not(p3)` becomes `not(p4) or false`. For this to be true, `not(p4)` must be true. So, `p4 = false`.\n    *   Clause (13): `not(p3) or p8` becomes `false or p8`. For this to be true, `p8` must be true. So, `p8 = true`.\n\nAt this point, we have derived the following assignments:\n*   `p1 = true`\n*   `p3 = true`\n*   `p5 = true`\n*   `p6 = true`\n*   `p4 = false`\n*   `p8 = true`\n\nNow, let's use these derived assignments to simplify other clauses and look for further derivations or contradictions.\n\n*   Consider clause (19): `not(p9) or not(p8) or not(p1)`\n    *   Substitute `p8 = true` (so `not(p8) = false`).\n    *   Substitute `p1 = true` (so `not(p1) = false`).\n    *   The clause becomes `not(p9) or false or false`, which simplifies to `not(p9)`.\n    *   For this clause to be true, `not(p9)` must be true. So, `p9 = false`.\n\n*   Consider clause (27): `not(p6) or not(p1) or p9`\n    *   Substitute `p6 = true` (so `not(p6) = false`).\n    *   Substitute `p1 = true` (so `not(p1) = false`).\n    *   The clause becomes `false or false or p9`, which simplifies to `p9`.\n    *   For this clause to be true, `p9` must be true. So, `p9 = true`.\n\nWe have derived `p9 = false` from clause (19) and `p9 = true` from clause (27). These two derivations directly contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, the set of statements is unsatisfiable.\n\ncontradiction"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 934, "candidatesTokenCount": 1343, "totalTokenCount": 9400, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 934}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 7123}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "3q_2aPm0F5e_vdIPyOrHoA8"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 934, "output_tokens": 1343, "reasoning_tokens": 7123}, "timing_ms": 42903, "error": null}

So, `p4 = True`.\n\nNow we have `p1=True`, `p8=True`, `p2=True`, `p3=True`, `p5=True`, `p9=True`, `p6=True`, `p7=True`, `p11=True`, `p4=True`.\n\nFrom `p4` being true:\n*   Clause 19: `~p4 v p10` becomes `False v p10`, which implies `p10` is true. So, `p10 = True`.\n\nAt this point, all propositional variables are derived to be true:\n`p1 = True`\n`p2 = True`\n`p3 = True`\n`p4 = True`\n`p5 = True`\n`p6 = True`\n`p7 = True`\n`p8 = True`\n`p9 = True`\n`p10 = True`\n`p11 = True`\n\nNow, let's check if any clause is contradicted by this assignment. Consider clause 42:\n`p10 is false or p4 is false or p2 is false or p1 is false.`\nIn CNF notation, this is `~p10 v ~p4 v ~p2 v ~p1`.\n\nSubstitute the derived truth values into this clause:\n`~True v ~True v ~True v ~True`\n`False v False v False v False`\n\nThis clause evaluates to `False`.\nSince we derived that all variables must be true, and this clause states that at least one of `p10`, `p4`, `p2`, or `p1` must be false, there is a contradiction.

So, `p6` is **True**.\n*   (19) `not(p12) or not(p2) or p3` is `not(p12) or not(p2) or T`, satisfied.\n*   (21) `not(p11) or not(p3) or p5` becomes `not(p11) or False or p5`, simplifying to `not(p11) or p5`.\n*   (23) `not(p10) or not(p8) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p10) or not(p8) or False`, simplifying to `not(p10) or not(p8)`.\n*   (24) `not(p9) or not(p3) or not(p2)` becomes `not(p9) or False or not(p2)`, simplifying to `not(p9) or not(p2)`.\n*   (25) `not(p8) or not(p5) or not(p4)` becomes `not(p8) or not(p5) or False`, simplifying to `not(p8) or not(p5)`.\n*   (28) `not(p6) or not(p3) or p12` becomes `not(T) or not(T) or p12`, which is `False or False or p12`, simplifying to `p12`. So, `p12` is **True**.\n*   (30) `not(p4) or not(p1) or p2` becomes `not(T) or not(p1) or p2`, which is `False or not(p1) or p2`, simplifying to `not(p1) or p2`.\n*   (31) `not(p12) or not(p8) or not(p3) or p11` becomes `not(p12) or not(p8) or False or p11`, simplifying to `not(p12) or not(p8) or p11`.\n*   (34) `not(p11) or not(p9) or not(p5) or not(p3)` becomes `not(p11) or not(p9) or not(p5) or False`, simplifying to `not(p11) or not(p9) or not(p5)`.\n*   (35) `not(p11) or not(p8) or not(p2) or p4` is `not(p11) or not(p8) or not(p2) or T`, satisfied.\n*   (36) `not(p11) or not(p6) or not(p3) or p5` becomes `not(p11) or not(T) or not(T) or p5`, which is `not(p11) or False or"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "MAX_TOKENS", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 1011, "candidatesTokenCount": 1806, "totalTokenCount": 11009, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 1011}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 8192}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "27X2aIiSA_2D7M8PoJv_yAw"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1011, "output_tokens": 1806, "reasoning_tokens": 8192}, "timing_ms": 51041, "error": null}

Since p10 is True, \u00acp10 is False. For the clause to be True, **p5 must be True**.\n\nApplying unit propagation with p13 (True):\n*   Clause (3): \u00acp13 \u2228 p2. Since p13 is True, \u00acp13 is False. For the clause to be True, **p2 must be True**.\n*   Clause (4): \u00acp13 \u2228 p12. Since p13 is True, \u00acp13 is False. For the clause to be True, **p12 must be True**.\n*   Clause (5): \u00acp12 \u2228 p13. Since p13 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n*   Clause (10): \u00acp6 \u2228 p13. Since p13 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n*   Clause (13): \u00acp3 \u2228 p13. Since p13 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n\nCurrent derived assignments:\n*   p10 = True\n*   p13 = True\n*   p5 = True\n*   p2 = True\n*   p12 = True\n\nApplying unit propagation with p5 (True):\n*   Clause (8): \u00acp9 \u2228 \u00acp5. Since p5 is True, \u00acp5 is False. For the clause to be True, **\u00acp9 must be True** (i.e., p9 is False).\n*   Clause (15): \u00acp1 \u2228 p5. Since p5 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n\nApplying unit propagation with p2 (True):\n*   Clause (9): \u00acp7 \u2228 p2. Since p2 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n*   Clause (11): \u00acp3 \u2228 \u00acp2. Since p2 is True, \u00acp2 is False. For the clause to be True, **\u00acp3 must be True** (i.e., p3 is False).\n*   Clause (14): \u00acp2 \u2228 p8. Since p2 is True, \u00acp2 is False. For the clause to be True, **p8 must be True**.\n\nCurrent derived assignments:\n*   p10 = True\n*   p13 = True\n*   p5 = True\n*   p2 = True\n*   p12 = True\n*   p9 = False\n*   p3 = False\n*   p8 = True\n\nApplying unit propagation with p9 (False):\n*   Clause (7): \u00acp9 \u2228 \u00acp6. Since p9 is False, \u00acp9 is True. This clause is satisfied.\n\nApplying unit propagation with p3 (False):\n*   Clause (12): \u00acp3 \u2228 p10. Since p3 is False, \u00acp3 is True. This clause is satisfied. (Also p10 is True, so it's doubly satisfied).\n\nApplying unit propagation with p8 (True):\n*   Clause (16): \u00acp1 \u2228 p8. Since p8 is True, this clause is satisfied.\n\nAll clauses have been satisfied by the following partial assignment:\n*   p10 = True\n*   p13 = True\n*   p5 = True\n*   p2 = True\n*   p12 = True\n*   p9 = False\n*   p3 = False\n*   p8 = True\n\nThe remaining variables (p1, p6, p7) can be assigned any truth value (e.g., False) and all clauses will remain satisfied. Since we found a consistent assignment that satisfies all clauses, the set of clauses is satisfiable.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{satisfiable}$"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 617, "candidatesTokenCount": 1124, "totalTokenCount": 3937, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 617}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 2196}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "Vrn2aJmSLbDVvdIP1NPL0QQ"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 617, "output_tokens": 1124, "reasoning_tokens": 2196}, "timing_ms": 16672, "error": null}

If `p12` is true, `not(p5) or p11` (`p5 => p11`).\n  If `p5 => p11` and `p11 => p5`, then `p5 <=> p11`.\n  So, if `p3` is true and `p12` is true, then `p5 <=> p11 <=> p13`.\n\n**Step 3: Assume `p1` is true**\n- (13) `not(p1) or p3` becomes `false or p3`, so `p3` is true.\n- (14) `not(p1) or p15` becomes `false or p15`, so `p15` is true.\n- (30') `not(p6) or p1` becomes `not(p6) or true`, which is true.

If a clause reduces to a single literal, that literal becomes a new unit fact.\n\n*   Clause 8: `not(p15) or p5`\n    *   Since `p15` is True, `not(p15)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or p5`, which means `p5` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p5 = True**\n\n*   Clause 9: `not(p15) or p14`\n    *   Since `p15` is True, `not(p15)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or p14`, which means `p14` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p14 = True**\n\n*   Clause 10: `not(p14) or p6`\n    *   Since `p14` is True, `not(p14)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or p6`, which means `p6` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p6 = True**\n\n*   Clause 16: `not(p6) or p9`\n    *   Since `p6` is True, `not(p6)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or p9`, which means `p9` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p9 = True**\n\n*   Clause 17: `not(p6) or p12`\n    *   Since `p6` is True, `not(p6)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or p12`, which means `p12` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p12 = True**\n\n**Current Known True Propositions:**\np1, p3, p7, p11, p13, p15, p5, p14, p6, p9, p12 are all True.\n\n**Round 2 of Unit Propagation:**\n\n*   Clause 33: `not(p12) or not(p9) or p4`\n    *   Since `p12` is True, `not(p12)` is False.\n    *   Since `p9` is True, `not(p9)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or False or p4`, which means `p4` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p4 = True**\n\n*   Clause 36: `not(p11) or not(p6) or p10`\n    *   Since `p11` is True, `not(p11)` is False.\n    *   Since `p6` is True, `not(p6)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or False or p10`, which means `p10` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p10 = True**\n\n**Current Known True Propositions:**\np1, p3, p7, p11, p13, p15, p5, p14, p6, p9, p12, p4, p10 are all True.\n\n**Round 3 of Unit Propagation:**\n\n*   Clause 26: `not(p16) or not(p10) or not(p1)`\n    *   Since `p10` is True, `not(p10)` is False.\n    *   Since `p1` is True, `not(p1)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `not(p16) or False or False`, which means `not(p16)` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p16 = False**\n\n*   Clause 32: `not(p12) or not(p10) or p2`\n    *   Since `p12` is True, `not(p12)` is False.\n    *   Since `p10` is True, `not(p10)` is False.\n    *   The clause simplifies to `False or False or p2`, which means `p2` must be True.\n    *   **New Fact: p2 = True**\n\n**Current Known Propositions:**\nTrue: p1, p3, p7, p11, p13, p15, p5, p14, p6, p9, p12, p4, p10, p2\nFalse: p16\n\n**Checking for Contradiction:**\n\nNow, let's check clause 41 with the derived values:\n*   Clause 41: `not(p6) or not(p2) or p16`\n    *   Substitute `p6 = True`: `not(True)` is False.\n    *   Substitute `p2 = True`: `not(True)` is False.\n    *   Substitute `p16 = False`.\n    *   The clause becomes `False or False or False`.\n    *   This evaluates to `False`.\n\nSince one of the clauses evaluates to False under the derived truth assignments, the set of clauses is a contradiction (unsatisfiable).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{contradiction}$"}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 1157, "candidatesTokenCount": 1364, "totalTokenCount": 8292, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 1157}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 5771}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "ss_2aObqJOnDvdIPrZDRmA8"}, "finish_reason": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1157, "output_tokens": 1364, "reasoning_tokens": 5771}, "timing_ms": 35360, "error": null}
