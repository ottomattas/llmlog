determine if the set of clauses is satisfiable or unsatisfiable.\n\nLet me start with the facts that must be true:\n- p1 = true\n- p5 = true  \n- p9 = true\n\nNow I'll propagate constraints:\n\nFrom clause 6 (p9 is false or p12 is true): Since p9=true, we need **p12 = true**\nThis is confirmed by clause 11 (p1 is false or p12 is true): Since p1=true, we need p12=true\n\nFrom clauses 7 and 8:\n- Clause 7: p8 is false or p7 is true\n- Clause 8: p7 is false or p8 is true\n\nThese together force: **p7 = true and p8 = true**\n\nFrom clause 36 (p11 is false or p9 is false or p8 is false or p7 is false):\nWith p9=true, p8=true, p7=true, we need **p11 = false**\n\nFrom clause 31 (p3 is false or p1 is false or p11 is true):\nWith p1=true and p11=false, we need **p3 = false**\n\nFrom clauses 19 and 49:\n- Clause 19: p9 is false or p6 is false or p4 is true \u2192 p6 is false or p4 is true\n- Clause 49: p5 is false or p4 is false or p1 is false or p6 is true \u2192 p4 is false or p6 is true\n\nThese together force: **(p4 = true and p6 = true) or (p4 = false and p6 = false)**\n\nFrom clause 55 (p9 is false or p8 is false or p5 is false or p4 is false or p2 is true):\nWith p9=true, p8=true, p5=true, we need p4=false or **p2 = true**\n\nSetting p4=true (which satisfies clauses 19 and 49) makes clause 55 satisfied by p2=true, so: **p4 = true, p6 = true, p2 = true**\n\nFor p10, no clause forces it to a specific value, so: **p10 = false**\n\nFinal assignment:\n- p1=true, p2=true, p3=false, p4=true, p5=true, p6=true, p7=true, p8=true, p9=true, p10=false, p11=false,
