This clause is satisfied.\n*   D1: \u00acp9 \u2228 \u00acp7 => True \u2228 \u00acp7. This clause is satisfied.\n\nLet's use p1 \u21d4 p7 to simplify C15:\n*   C15: \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2228 p7. Since p1 \u21d4 p7, we can substitute p7 with p1: \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2228 p1. This simplifies to \u00acp10 \u2228 True, which is always true.

So, \u00acp2 \u2228 False must be true, which means \u00acp2 must be true. Thus, **p2 = False**.\n\nNow we have:\n*   p1 = True\n*   p2 = False\n*   p3 = True\n*   p5 = True\n*   p6 = False\n*   p7 = True\n*   p8 = True\n*   p9 = False\n\nLet's check the remaining clauses with these values:\n*   C13: \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp4 \u2228 \u00acp1 => \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp4 \u2228 False. This simplifies to **\u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp4**.\n*   C14: \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp1 \u2228 p2 => \u00acp10 \u2228 False \u2228 False. This simplifies to **\u00acp10**. So, **p10 = False**.\n\nNow we have p10 = False. Let's use this:\n*   C4: \u00acp10 \u2228 p4 => True \u2228 p4. This clause is satisfied.\n*   C13 (simplified): \u00acp10 \u2228 \u00acp4 => True \u2228 \u00acp4.
