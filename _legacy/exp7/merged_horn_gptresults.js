Let's proceed step by step:  ### Initial Facts: `p2` `p6` `p7`  ### Rules:  `if p8 then p4`  `if p8 then p7`  `if p6 then p7`  `if p1 then p7`  `if p8 and p7 then p2`  `if p8 and p7 then p4`  `if p8 and p5 then p4`  `if p8 and p4 then p3`  `if p7 and p5 then p2` 10. `if p7 and p4 then p1` 11. `if p7 and p3 then p1` 12. `if p5 and p4 then p2` 13. `if p3 and p2 and p1 then p0` 14. `if p3 and p2 then p6` 15. `if p3 and p1 then p2` 16. `if p2 and p1 then p8` 17. `if p8 and p4 and p2 then p3` 18. `if p7 and p6 and p5 then p2` 19. `if p7 and p5 and p1 then p6` 20. `if p7 and p2 and p1 then p3` 21. `if p6 and p5 and p1 then p8`  ---  ### Step 1: Derive new facts from the initial facts (`p2`, `p6`, `p7`).  Rule 3: `if p6 then p7`.     `p6` is true, but `p7` is already known. No new fact.  No new facts can be derived in this step.  ---  ### Step 2: Check if `p0` can be derived.  To derive `p0`, Rule 13 requires `p3`, `p2`, and `p1`.     - `p2` is already known.     - `p3` and `p1` are not known, and no rules allow us to derive them with the current facts.  ---  ### Conclusion: No new facts can be derived, and `p0` cannot be derived. The answer is:  **no** "]

From Rule 1: `if p11 then p10` \u2192 `p10` is derived.  **New facts:** `p10`  ---  ### Step 2: Derive new facts from `p11` and `p10`.  From Rule 2: `if p10 then p6` \u2192 `p6` is derived. From Rule 10: `if p11 and p10 then p2` \u2192 `p2` is derived.

At this point, we have the facts: `p11`, `p10`, `p6`, `p2`, `p3`.  We cannot derive `p0` because the necessary conditions for any rule leading to `p0` are not satisfied (e.g., `p9`, `p5`, `p8`, etc., are missing).  ---  ### Final Answer: **no** "]

However, `p14` is already derived, so no new fact here.   `if p11 and p1 then p5`:      Since `p11` and `p1` are facts, we can derive `p5`. However, `p5` is already derived, so no new fact here.   `if p11 and p4 then p2`:      Since `p11` is a fact but `p4` is not, we cannot derive `p2`.   `if p14 and p11 and p6 then p3`:      Since `p14`, `p11`, and `p6` are facts, we can derive `p3`.      **New fact: `p3`**  ---  ### Iteration 3: Now we have the facts: `p1`, `p6`, `p12`, `p14`, `p5`, `p10`, `p9`, `p2`, `p11`, `p3`.   We check which rules can be applied to derive new facts:   `if p13 and p3 then p10`:      Since `p3` is a fact but `p13` is not, we cannot derive `p10`.   `if p10 and p9 and p6 then p13`:      Since `p10`, `p9`, and `p6` are facts, we can derive `p13`.      **New fact: `p13`**   `if p13 and p12 and p11 and p9 then p0`:      Since `p13`, `p12`, `p11`, and `p9` are facts, we can derive `p0`.      **New fact: `p0`**  ---  ### Conclusion: We have derived the target fact `p0`.
