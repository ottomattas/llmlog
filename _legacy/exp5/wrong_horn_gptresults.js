Let's proceed step by step:  ### Initial Facts: `p2` `p6` `p7`  ### Rules:  `if p8 then p4`  `if p8 then p7`  `if p6 then p7`  `if p1 then p7`  `if p8 and p7 then p2`  `if p8 and p7 then p4`  `if p8 and p5 then p4`  `if p8 and p4 then p3`  `if p7 and p5 then p2` 10. `if p7 and p4 then p1` 11. `if p7 and p3 then p1` 12. `if p5 and p4 then p2` 13. `if p3 and p2 and p1 then p0` 14. `if p3 and p2 then p6` 15. `if p3 and p1 then p2` 16. `if p2 and p1 then p8` 17. `if p8 and p4 and p2 then p3` 18. `if p7 and p6 and p5 then p2` 19. `if p7 and p5 and p1 then p6` 20. `if p7 and p2 and p1 then p3` 21. `if p6 and p5 and p1 then p8`  ---  ### Step 1: Derive new facts from the initial facts (`p2`, `p6`, `p7`).  Rule 3: `if p6 then p7`.     `p6` is true, but `p7` is already known. No new fact.  No new facts can be derived in this step.  ---  ### Step 2: Check if `p0` can be derived.  To derive `p0`, Rule 13 requires `p3`, `p2`, and `p1`.     - `p2` is already known.     - `p3` and `p1` are not known, and no rules allow us to derive them with the current facts.  ---  ### Conclusion: No new facts can be derived, and `p0` cannot be derived. The answer is:  **no** "]

Since p0 is derived, the answer is **yes**.  ---  ### Final Answer: p8 p1 p4 p5 p3 p2 p0 yes "]
