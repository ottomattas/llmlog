# experiments v4: specifically horn problems, with a detailed proof output

**Just 300 first horn clauses only, in the if...then representation, asking for a linear p1, p2, ... etc CoT output without full derivation steps**

problems_dist20_v1.js:
Problem set: 3..15 vars, 3..4 cllen, both horn and non-horn, 20 problems per distribution.

    horn_gptresults_v3.js:
    gpt solutions for the first 200 horn problems in the set above.
    Usage:
    gpt-4o-2024-11-20
    temperature=0
    seed=1234
    max_tokens=2000

NB! The file `wrong_horn_gptresults.js` interprets some LLM-produced texts incorrectly. `fix.py` takes this file and prints a fixed file.
`fixed_horn_gptresults.js` is a correctly interpreted results file.

The difference from exp3 (v3): 
* instead of representation with or-clauses, we use if...then clauses like "if p1 and p2 then p3".
* instead of asking about contradiction / satisfiability we ask whether a special variable p0 is derivable


Useful important prompt details:

    prefix="Your task is to solve a problem in propositional logic containing both facts and if-then rules.\n"
    prefix+="You will get a list of facts and if-then rules and have to determine whether a fact p0 can be derived from this list.\n"
    prefix+="If a fact p0 can be derived, the last word of your answer should be 'yes',\n"
    prefix+="otherwise the last word should be 'no'.\n\n"

    details="Facts are represented as 'pN' where N is a number. \n"
    details+="All the statements are either facts or if-then rules allowing to derive a single fact.  \n"
    details+="All the given statements are implicitly connected with 'and': they are all claimed to be true.\n"
    
    details+="In order to solve a given problem, you must use the following method:\n"
    details+="First, derive and print out all the facts which can be derived directly by some given if-then rule from the given facts in the input\n"
    details+="and which are not already present in the list of given statements as facts. \n\n"

    details+="Then, print out all the facts \n"
    details+="which can be similarly directly derived by some if-then rule from the newly printed facts and initially given facts \n"
    details+="and which have not been printed earlier.\n"
    details+="Then continue the same procedure of printing out new facts, until either no new facts can be derived or the fact p0 is derived.\n"
    details+="If the fact p0 is derived and printed, then finally print 'yes'. \n"
    details+="If no new facts can be derived and p0 is not derived, then finally print 'no'.\n\n"

    details+="Do not print out anything except the derivable facts and the final yes or no.\n\n"
